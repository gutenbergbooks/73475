</div>

<p>The purpose of this common-sense explanation
of Economic phenomena is to disclose and
emphasize those comprehensive and familiar
primary facts which embody the myriads of
secondary facts that are involved in Economic
science. To avoid confusing those complicated
details is to promote the clear thinking which
every Economic problem demands, be the
problem one of collegiate study, of political
policy, or of business importance.</p>

<p>The following pages aim, therefore, at encouraging
all thoughtful citizens so to classify
the details of the general subject in their own
minds as to enable them to avoid centering
their mental vision upon Economic trees so
intently that they cannot see the Economic
forest as a whole. It aims also at discouraging
the opposite inclination to view the Economic
forest so exclusively as a whole that
the Economic trees of which it is composed
cannot be distinguished.</p>

<span class="subhead">ECONOMICS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">On</span> the surface, Economics appears to be the science
of making money.</p>

<p>This appearance is due, however, to a careless recognition
and erroneous application of the fact that Economic
accomplishments are measured by money standards
and expressed in money terms.</p>

<p>When, for example, a builder builds, he builds to
make money. Money measures the Economic extent
of what he is doing, and money terms express its Economic
desirability. They also express and measure
his motive, which is the compensation he can command
in the currents of trade.</p>

<p>A merchant makes money when he manages a profitable
business.</p>

<p>So does a manufacturer.</p>

<p>Farmers make money when they sell their produce
profitably. Nor only when they sell it, but also while
they cultivate it; for every day’s growth adds to the
money measurement of a crop.</p>

<p>Wage-workers by the day, the week or month, and
salary-workers by the year, also workers on commission
or for percentages or for profits, make more or
less money as working opportunities are more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
plentiful, and wages or salaries or percentage totals
and profit totals are consequently higher or lower.</p>

<p>Engineers, lawyers, physicians, architects, dentists,
clergymen, teachers—all professional workers,—make
money to the extent of the marketability of the services
they offer.</p>

<p>And investors, do they not invest by money measurements
and in money terms for the purpose of obtaining
Economic incomes measured by money and
expressed in terms of money?</p>

<p>Manifestly, the immediate object of everybody’s activity
in the field of Economics is to make money.</p>

<p>Does one desire food? By making money he gets
food. Does one desire clothing? He gets it by making
money. Does he wish for housing, furnishings,
automobiles, railway or steamboat transportation, necessaries
of any kind, luxuries of whatever variety,
household service, professional service, legislative or
judicial service, mechanical service, mercantile service,
clerical service? By making money he gets them.
Does one wish for slaves? If slavery be an institution
of his time and place, he may have slaves by purchases
with the money he makes. Should he be a
slave himself, he may purchase his freedom with money
if he can get it. Does land-ownership appeal to one?
Let him make money and he can buy land. Whatever
object the Economic field may offer for the satisfaction
of human desires, that object is attainable by making
money. In no other way can it be attained through
Economic processes.</p>

<p>If gifts be cited as exceptions let the fact be noted
that giving is not an Economic process. It lacks the
element of exchange or trade. So, too, of theft in any
of its forms. In genuine Economics there must be
two gainers in every trade. There is no such science
as Economics of the Forty Thieves variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p>Even in such seeming exceptions to the Economic
importance of money as are offered by barter, in which
no money passes and no money accounting is made,
comparisons of the objects thus directly exchanged
are nevertheless contemplated by the exchangers in
terms of money. The owner of a horse that might
sell for two hundred dollars, would not barter it for
a horse that could sell for only one hundred—not
unless he got “boot” enough to even up the money
difference to his satisfaction. Nor would the boy with
a two-dollar penknife “swap even” for a one-dollar
jackknife. It is only when the two horses or the two
knives seem to their respective owners to be approximately
equal by money measurement that an “even
swap” is conceivable.</p>

<p>Another seeming exception to the money-making
characteristic of Economics depends upon individual
isolation. That isolated individuals may gather food
and improvise shelter and clothing without thinking of
them in terms of money, is true enough; but the activities
of persons thus isolated are not Economic exceptions,
for the science of Economics is a social science.
Although some Economic phases or phenomena may
be picturesquely and aptly illustrated by reference to
the experience, actual or imaginary, of isolated individuals
like Robinson Crusoe on his island, states of
human isolation are outside the limits of Economics.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, then, as the object of the human factor
in the science of Economics is to make money, and as
there can be no science of Economics without the
human factor, Economics is comprehensively and accurately
definable, on the surface, as the science of
making money.</p>

<p>But making money in the Economic sense must be
distinguished from narrower uses of the phrase. To
manufacture coins legitimately, as at a mint, is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
“make money,” but only in one Economic particular—only
in the narrow mechanical sense in which weaving
cloth is “making cloth.” Like weaving cloth, it is
but an item in the multitudinous phenomena of that
money-making which superficially defines the science
of Economics. The same observation is applicable to
the occupations of engraving and of printing paper
currency legitimately.</p>

<p>Illegitimate makings of either paper currency or
coin, like all other forms of forgery, are not in any
sense making money within the purview of Economic
science. They are varieties of theft, and Economic
science excludes theft of every kind, even legal kinds,
such as slavery. This exclusion is not for moral reasons,
it may be well to interject for the benefit of such
advanced students of Economics as recoil from mixing
moral principles with Economic science. It is due to
the fact that exchange, or trade—an essential element
in Economics,—is in theft utterly lacking.</p>

<p>In the Economic sense, making money is making
it for all concerned in any particular process, and not
for one or more of the parties at the expense of the
others. No art of getting something for nothing can
be within the scope of Economic science. One-sided
methods of making money, whether frankly labeled
“theft” or “gambling,” or shrewdly disguised in spurious
business ethics, are alien to Economic money-making.
Within the domain of Economics no money-making
transaction belongs unless it involves the
making of money by all parties to the transaction.</p>

<p>To make money in that mutual sense is to augment
the supply or the serviceableness of whatever commodities
money terms may measure and express, and
of the portions or shares of all who contribute to the
augmentation.</p>

<p>In phrasing more complete than that of “making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
money,” Economics is the science of making money
by earning it. Getting money without earning it is
related to Economics only in a science-disturbing
sense. It disturbs the normal Economic relations of
effect to cause in the production and dissemination of
humanly desirable objects. To realize the truth of
that statement, the student need only momentarily
conceive of theft as universal. Since universal theft
as an Economic phenomenon would be utterly destructive
of normal Economic relationships, of beneficial
effects from normal causes, so must theft to any extent
operate destructively to that extent. The only
thinkable relation of theft to Economics is analogous
to the relation of murder to the human race. That
Economic study may comprise considerations of how
to exclude stealing from Economic customs, does not
go to prove that stealing is a factor in Economic
science. It goes no farther than to prove that stealing
may become an Economic parasite.</p>

<p>Even as a parasite, stealing could hardly have
wormed its way to the Economic border line, much
less across it, but for a disposition among advanced
students to confuse normal Economic phenomena with
arbitrary business customs.</p>

<p>“Business” might indeed be the nearest approach to
a synonym for “Economics.” It would be an exact
synonym but for one variation. Whereas Economics
relates to a comprehensive social organism which
(notwithstanding “scientific” contentions to the contrary)
is subject to natural laws of human association
(sequences of cause and effect), Business is but a
limited collection of individual interests or private
organizations that are influenced and largely governed
by arbitrary customs. These customs may or may
not be in harmony with the normal relations of cause
and effect in Economics. And as to each particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
business, it is operated, as accountants frankly admit,
only “for the benefit of its proprietor.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a> The quotation is from “Modern Business”, by Thomas W. Mitchell,
Ph.&nbsp;D. New York: Alexander Hamilton Institute. 1918–1919.</p>

</div>

<p>In some of its vulgar connotations Business might
very well answer to the insolent definition that it consists
in the adventures of sprightly gentlemen trying
to sell nothing for something to other sprightly gentlemen
who are trying to buy something for nothing. In
so far, however, as that definition may be appropriate,
it applies only to business abuses, not to Business as
a possible synonym for Economics. It defines Business
only as theft might define morality.</p>

<p>To be a closer synonym for Economics, Business
must deserve a definition relating its customs to natural
Economic law (a subject to be considered in a
later Lesson) and extending its functions more completely
to universal mutual service. Moreover, its
definition must widen the Business concept so as to
include all kinds of such service. Business can no
more exclude from its realm particular Business specialties,
though that be customary, than it can include
the operations of “confidence men,” as it is sometimes
supposed to do. Its functions are not limited to commerce,
nor to banking, nor to any other of those Business
specialties to which careless speech, and sometimes
snobbish thought, tend to narrow the meaning
of the word.</p>

<p>Business is that function of social life which includes
all serviceable specialties. Such terms as “commercial,”
“mercantile,” “industrial,” “agriculture,”
“labor,” “the professions,” and so on, denominate specializations
or sections or subsidiary departments of
Business, not Business as a whole. They are useful
for subclassification; but, like all subclassifications,
whether in Economics or in any other science, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
are misleading when perverted into general terms for
primary or fundamental or comprehensive categories.
The term Business, like the term Economics, should
include them all. Every kind of service necessitates
busy-ness; and serviceable busy-ness, what is that but
Business?</p>

<p>Considered comprehensively, then, and excluding
parasitical adhesions, Business might be, as some advanced
students of Economic phenomena suppose it
to be, another name for Economics. In the scholastic
sense, Economics is the more orthodox term; in the
practical sense Business could better express the idea.
Both terms might have practically the same meaning
if considerately used. Honest Business, inclusive of
all serviceable activities—service for service, to adopt
a phrase in definition of Business—would be identical
with Economics. Either, like the other, may be described
superficially as the process of the science of
making money.</p>

<p>Quite consistently with the foregoing survey, Economics
has been described as the science of “mankind
making a living.” This definition, too, excludes
the solitary life by limiting Economic science to cooperative
mankind—in other words, to Economic association.
It, too, identifies Economics and legitimate
Business; for only through legitimate Business activities
can cooperative mankind make a living. It, too,
excludes theft in all its forms and guises; for so much
of a living as some may make by any kind of theft,
others must lose as victims of theft. It, too, brings
Economics on the surface and Business on the surface
within the definition of “the science of making money;”
for only by means of money measurements in money
terms does or can mankind in the mass make its living.</p>

<p>But making money is only a surface fact in Economics.
It is but a means to the end. By no possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
can it be rationally regarded as the ultimate
object. The ultimate object of Economics is earning
the living that money will buy. Both the object and
the method lie below the surface of money-making.
To Economics, making money is somewhat as book-keeping
is to a commercial business. It is the surface
expression of all underlying Economic phenomena.</p>

<p>Before those phenomena can be thoughtfully observed
and studied, the relation to them of money-making
must be keenly scrutinized and intelligently
considered.</p>

<span class="subhead">MONEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">What</span> is Money? and what are its functions?
Money is the medium of trade, its denominations
the language.</p>

<p>Resting on the surface of Economic phenomena,
Money and Money terms spread over the whole of
the Economic area. All subsurface phenomena in
Economics are measured in trade by Money units; the
details of trading transactions are discussed and recorded
in Money terms.</p>

<p>Money terms vary with localities. In the United
States, Money talks in terms of “dollars;” in Great
Britain in terms of “pounds sterling;” in France in
terms of “francs;” in Germany of “marks;” elsewhere
in local terms too numerous for other than encyclopedic
description. But the value measurements that
Money makes of commodities in the processes of trade
are everywhere, at any given time, practically the
same.</p>

<p>For lack of stability those measurements do vary
from time to time with confusing effect. To compare
them with measuring rods for length, breadth and
thickness, it is as if yards, feet and inches were constantly
contracting and expanding with reference not
only to the magnitude of measurable objects but also
to one another. Precisely in that way does Money in
fact fluctuate. It always has, and unless scientifically
standardized, it always will.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whatever the fluctuations and local
discrepancies of Money may be, it everywhere talks,
when its language is translated, to the same general
Economic effect at any given time. Stabilized, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
might be, it would talk to the same general Economic
effect everywhere and all the time.</p>

<p>What language is to thought, Money terms are to
trade. The trading transactions of the whole world
are effected by means of Money standards and in the
language of universally interpretable Money terms.</p>

<p>Conventionally defined, Money consists of coins
minted by governments from precious metals more or
less alloyed. Those forms are supplemented, however,
with subsidiary forms commonly known as “currency.”</p>

<p>There is an Economic theory that metal coins alone
are Money, paper currency being but promissory
notes redeemable in coin. This theory is useful for
testing Money media by coinage standards. But with
reference to nearly if not all purposes of current trade,
the intrinsic value of the Money piece is of slight
Economic importance, or would be if Money were
stabilized.</p>

<p>What counts in Economic measurements is Money
denominations—Money language rather than Money
pieces. For in the world-wide processes of trade, only
a slight proportion of either metal coin or paper currency
passes from hand to hand. Nearly all Money
measurements are entered in books of account; and in
these the debits and the credits so nearly offset one
another, by and large, that the difference as a whole
is too slight for consideration in passing down from
the Money surface of Economics to the basic facts.
A common and impressive exemplification is afforded
by clearinghouse statistics. These show that the
enormous banking transactions in Money terms which
merge at the clearings daily, are balanced off with a
trifling percentage of tangible Money.</p>

<p>Let the fact be emphasized then, that in defining
Money as the medium of trade, Money terms rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
than Money forms are to be understood as the trading
medium.</p>

<p>When a customer at a retail store buys a supply of
groceries, his payment may be made in Money pieces,
either metal or paper. Yet it may be made instead
with a check drawn against his bank balance, or
through a charge to his account in the retailer’s books.
If paid in Money pieces, either at the time of purchase
or later, some if not all of those pieces will go to
the storekeeper’s bank and be credited to him in
Money terms on the books of the bank. If the payment
be made by check, the amount of the check will
be entered in the storekeeper’s bank account as if it
were a payment in Money pieces instead of Money
terms. Be such transactions as they may, however,—cash
payments or check payments or drafts or promissory
notes—tangible Money plays on the whole but a
small part.</p>

<p>From purchases by customers at retail stores back
to wholesalers; back of wholesalers to manufacturers
of finished products and of unfinished products and of
tools and of every other kind of merchantable object;
back to land-owners for the sources of supply and the
sites for production and delivery; back to farmers, to
miners, to transportation agencies, to a vast though
scattered army of wage-workers; through many a complicated
series of accounts at stores, factories, mines,
real-estate offices, railway and steamship offices, banks,
clearinghouses—must we wend our way if we would
investigate the processes of trade in detail. Yet only
in slight degree do those processes involve the use of
Money forms. Though coinage standards play their
part, almost all trading transactions are made in
Money terms and not with Money pieces.</p>

<p>In the process, then, of making a living, mankind
trades commodities in terms of Money rather than in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
its forms, doing so principally through financial accounts.
Peering into the details of those accounts
(as professional accountants and other business specialists
must often do when examining the particulars
of their respective specialties), however useful this
may be within the limits of the specialization, is always
futile and often confusing or misleading for
purposes of Economic study or investigation as a
whole. In Economics the purpose is not to understand
the technical details of business specialties
simply. It is chiefly to relate those details to one another
by determining their respective Economic categories
so that the whole subject may be reasoned
about comprehensively.</p>

<p>Some business specialties may necessitate a knowledge
in detail of the physical characteristics of sugar,
for instance, or of cotton; but what an understanding
of the science of Economics requires in such particulars
is an intelligent grasp of the nature of sugar or cotton
with reference to fundamental Economic categories—whether
they are human, or natural, or artificial,—and
to what extent, therefore, they are Economically
related to all other commodities in the realm of trade.
For into one or the other of those three categories,
all the myriads of Economic details assemble themselves.</p>

<p>For purposes of Economic specialization, this assignment
of details to categories is not enough; but without
it no specialization is dependable. Some such
identification of particular facts with reference to their
fundamental differences or identities, is absolutely
necessary for accurate observation of Economic phenomena
and clearness of Economic thought; and are
not accurate observation and clarity of thought the
prime requisites of Economic study?</p>

<p>Not to make those identifications and differentiations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
is to turn Economics into the hopeless mixture
of “masses of particular unexplained facts” which John
Morley deplored as characteristic of a certain type of
Economic science. “Scraps and pickings of reality”
are worse than useless in any study of Economic
science unless harmoniously classified according to
their respective fundamental characteristics.</p>

<p>This comment does not mean that Economic details
are to be ignored except for classification, even by non-specialists.
Far from that. It means that they are
to be thoughtfully considered and accurately classified
for further and comparative consideration. To illustrate:
Mankind must be regarded as a class or category
in Economics; but not according to personal or
individual capabilities, idiosyncracies, or social, business,
or legal status. To the business specialist, the
personal qualities of an associate or assistant are important;
but Economics as a comprehensive science,
the science of all “mankind making a living,” knows
those special distinctions only in a secondary sense.
It is concerned primarily with the individual man only
as a unit in the human mass—only from the fact that
he is in the human category and not in one or more
other Economic categories. So of all Economic facts.
To study Economic details without reference to Economic
generalizations might be likened to studying
an alphabet without reference to language, or numerals
without reference to mathematics. Economic
problems are not problems of how one individual may
make a living at the expense of others. Such problems
belong in the plundering pursuits. In Economics
the basic problem is how all may make a living at the
expense of none.</p>

<p>To that problem business details give no clew, unless
the details be assigned to fundamental Economic
categories. Piling up details without assigning them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
is, as Henry James the Elder wisely expressed it, to
“sink the truth in endless confusion.” The last person
in all the world from whom to get the basic facts of
Economics is the business specialist, for he habitually
limits his observations to his own specialty. Perhaps,
however, a certain type of Economic teacher may be
equally untrustworthy in that respect—the teacher
who, though he imitates the physical scientist in devotion
to details, disregards the physical scientist’s
fidelity to the relations of cause and effect.</p>

<p>On the Economic surface we have the category of
Money. To the wage-worker Money is the medium
for trading the commodities he helps to produce for
those he wishes to consume. To the merchant, however,
or the manufacturer, or other Economic specializer,
Money presents also a variety of minute details
for expert study. The business accountant, for example,
must familiarize himself with numerous details
in connection with Money in its minute relationships
to his specialty. He might very likely confuse facts
Economically different, yet as a special business matter
practically identical—the Money measurement of a
natural mineral deposit, for instance, with the Money
measurement of its artificial equipment. As an accountant
in that specialty he would be right in doing
so. Or, in slavery days, for another instance, an accountant
might properly have classified the Money
measurement of a human chattel with that of a domesticated
horse or a constructed house. He also
would have been right; for, as an accountant, he would
have been dealing with a customary classification of
private property; and not with Economic science comprehensively.
It is doubtless specialty work of such
kinds that has involved the science of Economics in
so much confusion, especially among advanced students<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
who are prone to identify business conventionalities
with Economic normalities.</p>

<p>As a science, Economics cannot make its categories
according to conventional maladjustments. It must
make them according to essential differences. These
admit of no categorical identification of mineral deposits
with mining machinery, or of human beings
with domesticated animals or buildings. Such classifications
are as absurd in Economics as identifying sun
and earth would be in astronomy, or bone with brain
in anatomy.</p>

<p>The science of Economics—that is to say, the science
of Business in the broad social sense in contradistinction
to the narrow private sense—neither requires nor
permits such classifications as slaves with domesticated
animals, or mining machinery with natural mineral
deposits. It is obedient to the ancient but still vital
maxim of philosophy that things which are essentially
different must not be mixed nor things that are essentially
the same be separated.</p>

<p>Essentially different things in Economics are indeed
confused by Money, which knows no difference, except
in degree of Money measurement, between slaves
and cattle, or mineral deposits and mining machinery.
As the medium of trade, Money must measure the
values of everything tradable; and custom may make
tradable objects—human beings, for instance,—which
in the science of Economics are no more within the
normal boundaries of trade than are transfers by theft.</p>

<p>Whether we think of Money as tangible coin, or
only as the Money signs and symbols of account
books, Money is not a basic fact in Economics. Mankind
cannot live upon Money. It is neither eatable
nor wearable. Nor is it shelter. Likewise of Money
terms. Money is a secondary Economic factor—a
representative of value, whereby the relative desirability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
of commodities is measured and expressed in
trade. It is therefore the comprehensive surface-fact
of Economics beneath which the basic facts must be
sought.</p>

<p>In other phrasing, Money is that secondary category
in Economics which comprehends every kind and form
of medium for trading commodities in the world-wide
process that we descriptively characterize as “mankind
making a living.” Mankind being a basic Economic
category, and the process of making a living being the
Economic human necessity and purpose, Money can
have but one comprehensive significance in Economics.
Be it in the form of coin, or in the form of paper
currency, or in the form of entries in books of account
(where it appears only in name and arithmetical denominations),
it is the universal medium and Economic
measuring rod of exchanges or trade.</p>

<p>Whether one makes Money or not depends, as a
rule, upon which side of his accounts in ledgers the
Money balance appears at final accountings. It is
Money in this sense that goes farthest to justify the
superficial definition of Economics as the science of
making money.</p>

<p>We only skim the surface of Economic phenomena,
however, by coming to an understanding of the nature
and the function of Money. Money is only one of the
secondary categories which must be identified and
properly related in any thoughtful study of Economic
science. Below that financial surface are phenomena
which Money merely measures and compares. The
first of those underlying phenomena is Trade, for
which Money is the medium and upon which our attention
must next be concentrated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THIRD_LESSON"><span id="toclink_17"></span>THIRD LESSON<br>

<span class="subhead">TRADE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Trade, for</span> which Money is the Economic medium
and Money-terms the Economic language, consists
superficially in interchanges of tangible commodities,
but essentially in interchanges of human service.</p>

<p>Tangible commodities, with a semi-exception as to
real estate, are produced by interchanges of human
service from the very extreme of the primary production
of those commodities to and including their final
delivery for ultimate consumption. Real estate, too,
is thus produced in so far as it consists of structures,
of soil cultivation, of mining mechanisms, of excavations,
or of any other kind of artificial alteration.</p>

<p>All commodities are subjects of Trade. Artificial
commodities, such as depend upon human service for
production, are not only subjects of Trade but are
also its products. This is absolutely true of every
kind of artificial commodity that is produced to completion,
inclusive of final delivery, by means of Economic
specializations—specializations in human service.
The primary materials and the unfinished parts
are gathered together and delivered, both in the intricate
process and finally, by means of Trade.</p>

<p>A loaf of bread, for example, is brought to completion
from harvest-field to bakery, and thence as a
finished product, through many deliveries (including
delivery to its ultimate consumer) by means of Trade.
So is the implement with which it is cut at the consumer’s
table, and the plate on which it rests, the
table at which it is served, the cloth which covers the
table, the chair in which the consumer sits at the
table, and the dining room floor beneath them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Of the vast variety of such commodities as loaves
of bread and knives for cutting them and plates and
tables and tablecloths by means of which they are
served for ultimate consumption, very few if any at
all of that variety of commodities—whether finished,
as a loaf of bread on the consumer’s table, or unfinished,
as the growing grain or the flour of which the
loaf is composed, or the fuel that bakes it, or the
bricks or the metal of the baker’s oven, or the finished
oven itself—give distinctive expression to all the
human services they embody.</p>

<p>That fact could be further illustrated with any artificial
commodity in course of Trade. A hogshead of
molasses on a wharf would answer the purpose. To
thoughtless observation this commodity might seem
to embody no other human service than work on a
sugar plantation and by barrel-makers in a coopering
shop. But if we think about it with penetration and
clarity, we readily realize that it embodies the services
also of lumbermen, of miners, of railway workers, of
bankers, possibly of importers and mariners, probably
of exporters and their assistants, certainly of draymen,
of wharfmen, of merchants, of book-keepers and other
accountants—a veritable host of specialists whose contributory
services are not emphasized by the tangible
commodity (a hogshead of molasses on a wharf) as
are the services of plantation-hands and barrel-makers.
Multitudes of human services in distracting variety
are concealed in that familiar commodity from the
vision of all but specialists; perhaps from their vision
too in so far as the services are outside of their respective
specialties. And if we were to follow that
hogshead of molasses to its Economic destination, we
might perceive many an additional human service embodied
and concealed in commodities of Trade for
which the material would have been supplied in part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
by molasses from the hogshead and probably in part
by the hogshead itself.</p>

<p>Trade is not a mere business custom, as is sometimes
carelessly supposed. Only to the extent that
they conform to natural Economic law can trading
customs be socially beneficial or continue without developing
social disaster.</p>

<p>Many customs do enter into Trade, even as habits
enter into the life of individuals—some beneficial and
some vicious, some in harmony with natural law and
some defiant or evasive of it. But essentially Trade
is a natural expression of Economic relationships. It
is consequently as dependent upon conformity to natural
laws as are the physical functions of individuals.
Drawing inspiration continuously from natural human
impulses, giving constant and increasing satisfaction
to natural human needs, bringing natural human units
ever closer into a natural social whole, contributing
one of the two indispensable and fundamentally effective
as well as obvious natural powers and facilities
for the continuous and increasing production of human
satisfactions, Trade is evidently as natural to the social
whole as is breathing or eating to the individual.
It must therefore be as completely subject to natural
law.</p>

<p>By nature man is “a trading animal.” So it has
often been said, and the saying is manifestly true.
There is, however, no implication here that man is an
animal only. The suggestion is that, although an
animal, he is more than an animal, and that Trade
develops phenomena which go to prove it.</p>

<p>Of all animals, man only is within the jurisdiction
of the natural Economic laws of Trade. What other
animal than man could be correctly described, in a
comprehensive sense, as “a trading animal”? Not
only is this characteristic distinctive. Not only is it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
peculiarly human. But also, and by force of natural
Economic law—not commercial custom, but those
natural sequences of effect from cause to which arbitrary
commercial customs must yield or come to grief,—it
enables mankind, the larger man, the social man,
to multiply the Economic powers of each individual
of the human race.</p>

<p>Primary among those natural laws of Trade is the
thoroughly tested sequence alluded to above, that
Trade multiplies productive power. It does so by inviting,
requiring and developing that characteristic
phenomenon of Trade which is commonly called “division
of labor,” but may be distinguished best as Economic
specialization.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> This phenomenon gives to the
world, gives to it as a natural effect of Trade, a productive
power per capita far and away beyond the
productive power of any isolated individual.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a> The principle of Economic specialization could hardly be better illustrated
than by the reply of an old-time compositor in a printing establishment
who contemplated making a contract for the erection of a cottage home
for himself and his family, when a friend suggested that he might save
money by digging the cellar himself between working hours at the case.
He replied: “I can dig a better cellar and more easily at the case with a
composing-stick than on the spot with a pick and shovel.”</p>

</div>

<p>By means of a vast variety of Economic specialties—such
for illustration as farming, engineering, mining,
lumbering and their respective and numerous subdivisions,
through a vast variety of other Economic
specialties, such as transporting and manufacturing
and merchandizing, along with their respective and
multitudinous subdivisions, all supplemented by such
other Economic specialties as banking, teaching,
preaching, adjudicating, writing, acting, and the fine
arts—the necessaries for individual sustenance and the
luxuries for individual enjoyment are produced and
delivered in quantity, variety and perfection which,
when calculated per capita, rise far above and extend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
far beyond all the possibilities of isolated individual
life, far above and beyond the possibilities of community
life in narrow environments.</p>

<p>Were there but one individual to be considered, the
natural advantages of Trade would seem as fanciful
as a fairy story. Were there only a small group, the
natural advantages of Trade, though manifest, would
be too few and too primitive to disclose its wondrous
powers of production. But when millions of individuals
cooperate, some serving all and all serving each
through the intricacies of worldwide Trade, mankind
is welded into an Economic unity, a gigantic oneness—a
larger human being, “the social man” as this social
organism is sometimes not inaptly called—an organism
composed of individuals who give it vitality and whom
in consequence it serves as a beneficent giant might
serve a cooperating pigmy.</p>

<p>Involving the production of commodities by individual
contributors of human service through an infinity
of specializations, and their assignment to individuals
by the intricate processes of service for service,
Trade tends not only to increase the per capita
supply of commodities, but also to effect their fair
per capita assignment in proportions corresponding to
the relative desirability of the numerous and various
contributions of individual service to their production.</p>

<p>In describing Trade as consisting essentially of interchanges
of human services, we are of course to be
understood as including not only such services as are
embodied in tangible commodities, but also personal
service. Nor does it make any Economic difference
whether the personal service be of the “servant” type
or of the “professional” type.</p>

<p>“Professional” services, such as those of Economists,
Engineers, Architects, Clergymen, Lawyers,
Physicians and Teachers are in the Economic domain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
of Trade. Not only are they exchanged for tangible
commodities, but they contribute to the production of
such commodities by conserving, and it may be by increasing
the efficiency of more obvious producers. The
Economist studies productive relationships for the purpose
of securing harmonious industrial adjustments;
and so vital is his function that righteous social relationships
are imperiled, and righteous readjustments
obstructed, if he mistakes chaos for order. The Engineer
designs, plans and directs; and so important is
his function that the work of hosts of producers depends
upon it. If he mistakes, great structures may
fall. The Architect is an Engineer in a special sense:
if he makes mistakes, buildings may lack stability or
beauty or both. The Lawyer may disentangle societary
complications that would operate as a check upon
production and Trade. The Clergyman may discourage
obstructive conduct; the Physician may conserve
the health of more direct producers so as to increase
their efficiency; the Teacher may increase their efficiency
by instruction. And so of personal services of
the Personal Servant type. Whatever a Personal
Servant may do for a commodity specialist which
otherwise the specialist must do for himself at the
cost of contributing less to the production of tangible
commodities, is to that extent a contribution to the
production of those commodities. Interchanges of
human service, if the interchangers act in freedom, each
getting from the channels of Trade the equivalent in
service of the service he renders, are contributions to
Economic production.</p>

<p>The relative desirability of human services rendered
in promoting production, whether directly or indirectly,
is commonly as well as commercially and
Economically known as Value, which, as already explained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
is expressed in Money terms and compared
by Money measurements.</p>

<p>To receive a share in the continuous distribution of
commodities through Trade is the human motive for
all Economic activity, from leadership in Economic
service to service for “wages.”</p>

<p>A “wage-worker,” for illustration, lends a hand—becomes
“a hand,” if you please,—at harvesting wheat.
His compensation is to be, let us assume, his food
and lodging during harvest and twenty dollars in
Money at the end of his job. The work being done,
his food and lodging having been meanwhile supplied
to him, and the twenty dollars in Money having been
duly paid him, what has been the Economic nature of
his transaction? Has not this “harvest hand” exchanged
his contribution of service to the production
of wheat, for his living while helping to produce it
and for a twenty-dollar measurement of any commodity
or commodities he may wish to draw from the channels
of Trade?</p>

<p>Assume now that he draws from those channels a
pair of shoes, a hat and other commodities at the village
store, including, perhaps, some tobacco for his
pipe and a bit of candy for a little friend. As matter
of Economics, then, what has he done but Trade his
service at harvesting for his living while at work and
some service-produced commodities for still further
satisfying his desires?</p>

<p>And the Economic leader in that connection, the
farmer who hired the “harvest hand,” what has been
his part in the transaction? In the last analysis has
he not for harvest service traded food, house accommodations,
household service, and his Money title to
twenty dollars’ worth of any commodity or commodities
that may be flowing through the channels of
Trade—a title for which he presumably has given, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
through debit and credit adjustments must in the
future give, his own service or the service of others
which he may naturally and justly or only customarily
and unjustly command as his own?</p>

<p>When an employer in any branch of Economics
pays an employee “wages” or “salary” or other compensation
for service, he buys his employee’s service
by an interchange, through Trade, of human service
for human service.</p>

<p>Nor are interchanges of service limited to employers
and employees.</p>

<p>The point of final interchange is almost invariably
like the illustrative instance of the “harvest hand” at
a retail store. Through the processes of Trade, myriads
of commodities for the satisfaction of human
wants, commodities produced by human service to
the point of delivery to ultimate consumers, flow to
ultimate consumers out of retail stores. These depots
for final delivery in Trade are the customary terminals
of production, where certifications of service in terms
of Money are usually exchanged for products of service
in the form of commodities.</p>

<p>Although such exchanges, like other exchanges
throughout the processes of Trade, are made in Money
terms and by Money measurements, these terms and
measurements testify, as explained in the preceding
Lesson, only to the relative values which govern the
exchangeable relations of any commodity or commodities
with any other commodity or commodities.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Economic students who ignore
“value levels” readily recognize “price levels.” But
what else are “price levels” than “value levels” expressed
in Money terms? If a hammer will exchange
for a chisel in the processes of Trade, they are of
equal value—not price, but value. If the Money price
of one is two dollars and that of the other is also two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
dollars, they are of equal price as well as equal value.
And except as Money may vary in purchasing power
through lack of stabilization, or commodities may vary
in relative desirability or industrial cost, the price
level and the value level tend to rise and fall together.
That is to say, the essential consideration is
one of relative values of commodities (which is determined
by difficulties of production and delivery),
but the superficial consideration is the purchasing
power of Money, by which those relative values are
more or less accurately measured and expressed in
price lists.</p>

<p>Values thus expressed rise and fall. They do so in
terms of Price when measured by Money; they do
so in the essentials of Value when measured by comparisons
of commodities. As a rule, however, Money-prices
are fair guides to Commodity values. Commodity
values rise and fall according to cost of production,
inclusive of delivery; and in so far as Money
is stable, the rise and fall in prices is evidence of variations
in production cost.</p>

<p>The relative rise and fall in Value, be it measured
by prices in Money or otherwise, is so common a
phenomenon of Trade that critics might be pardoned
for denying a Value level.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there is such a level. It may be illustrated
by “sea level.” We readily understand and
confidently base important physical calculations upon
the assumption of a constantly level sea. Yet there
is no such thing. Waves rise above the surface of
the sea at their crest and fall below it in their hollows.
Tides contribute other variations. So with Value in
Trade. Literally a level of Value is unknown.
Values continually rise and fall, like the waves and
the tides of the sea. Yet there is as to Value a “mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
level.” Such a level or tendency may be found in the
relation of service-cost to consumption-desirability.</p>

<p>Though we measure service-value by Money, though
Money fluctuates as a Value-measuring device, though
some individual services fall in product value relatively
to the productive power of service, though some
individual services may increase in Value for one
reason or another, there is nevertheless a Value level
in Trade which tends constantly to maintain an equilibrium
between service-value and service-utility.
Money-measured Value and Money standards of Value
may rise above or fall below the service-cost of produced
commodities. Nevertheless, service-cost in commodities
is the determining fact—the Value level in
Trade. Measured and expressed by Money, that Value
level is the Price level.</p>

<p>Trade phenomena, to which this Lesson has been
devoted, though they lead down to the Basic Facts,
the foundation facts, of Economics, do not themselves,
either wholly or in any of their details, belong in the
Basic Fact region. Though nearer to the Basic Facts
of Economics than the phenomena of Money, our consideration
of which immediately preceded our consideration
of Trade, the phenomena of Trade are one
layer above the Basic Facts toward which we have
been delving down from the Economic surface, Money,
and through the subsurface, Trade. To the Basic
Facts of Economics our next Lesson will be devoted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOURTH_LESSON"><span id="toclink_27"></span>FOURTH LESSON<br>

<span class="subhead">THE BASIC FACTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> purpose of the preceding Lessons has been to
pierce through the surface and the immediate subsurface
of Economics down to the Basic Facts. On
the surface, as we have seen, Economics appears to
be the science of making Money, whereas Money is
in fact only the medium and measure of Value in
Trade. We have further seen that the immediate subsurface,
Trade, consists apparently in exchanges of
tangible commodities but essentially in interchanges
of human service. We are now to inspect the Basic
Facts.</p>

<p>The Basic Facts of Economics consist of natural
groupings or categories of all the myriads of minor
facts with which the science of Economics is concerned.
Of those categories there are exactly three.
By no possibility can there be more; by no possibility
can there be less. Natural law fixes the number.</p>

<p>The first Basic Fact—not first in order of creation,
but first in our perceptions of Economic necessity—is
Man. Without Man, Economics could have neither
incentive nor power, neither cause nor effect.</p>

<p>The second Basic Fact is Natural Resources, without
which Man could not exist. Natural Resources comprise
the surface of our globe, together with all natural
objects external to Man and in their natural condition,
upon the surface, under the surface, and above the
surface, including the air surrounding the surface.</p>

<p>Through applications of the energies of the first to
the offerings of the second, Artificial Objects are produced,
and these constitute the third of the three.</p>

<p>To one or another of those three natural categories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
every variety of detail that may be involved in any
Economic problem must be assigned. Not so to
assign those details to their appropriate categories is
to invite confusion of thought and to risk arriving at
false and socially dangerous conclusions.</p>

<p>The Economic student who mixes such Natural Resources
as building sites with such Artificial Objects
as buildings, or natural deposits of minerals with
mining machinery, or natural surfaces with railway
roadbeds and tracks and equipment, or farming tracts
with farm improvements, or human slaves with real
estate or stocks of merchandize or factory mechanisms,
makes an inexcusable blunder.</p>

<p>Such mixtures may be unobjectionable in accountings
of the assets of a private business for private
purposes; but in general Economics they are perplexing
and misleading. In this comprehensive social
science every Economic detail must be classified in
harmony with the three Basic Facts—Man, Natural
Resources and Artificial Objects,—or confused thinking
will result. To make those classifications, however,
is to lay a firm foundation for correctly estimating
Economic phenomena of all possible kinds and in
all their relations.</p>

<p>The human factor, Man—an impossibility without
Natural Resources in the comprehensive sense of that
term,—applies his energies of mind and body to the
Natural Resources of our terrestrial globe and its enveloping
atmospheres, thereby producing and for his
satisfaction consequently consuming every variety of
Artificial object within the range of his Economic desires
and his Economic capabilities. This is true of
Man and of Man only.</p>

<p>Lower animals do not produce Artificial Objects.
Do they cultivate? No. Do they design or invent?
No. Do they Trade? No. Do they in any way improve?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
No. As was eloquently said by a distinguished
Economist of the last century, “the sea-gull of the
English Channel who poises himself above the swift
steamer, wants no better food or lodging than the
gulls who circled round as the keels of Caesar’s galleys
first grated on a British beach.”</p>

<p>If wild birds make nests and wild animals make
burrows or build dams, and wild bees make honey,
so do wild berry bushes grow berries and wild apple
trees bear apples; yet who would think of classifying
wild fruits as Artificial Objects? Manifestly, uncultivated
fruit is as truly in the category of Natural
Resources as is the wild tree or bush that bears it.
And how do wild animals and their characteristic
products differ in that respect from wild fruit bushes
and wild fruit trees? Evidently in no wise at all.
Their products of nest and burrow and water-dam and
all the rest, like the leafing and the fruitage of the
tree and the bush, are natural objects. They are not
artificial. An Artificial Object is a product of human
invention and construction. For every purpose of
Economic classification, wild animals, like wild trees
and wild bushes and wild Nature in all its varieties,
belong in the category of Natural Resources. When
the wild trees or the wild bushes are cultivated, or the
wild animals are domesticated, they pass into the category—as
manifestly as buildings and farm produce do—of
Artificial Objects drawn forth from and upon
Natural Resources by Man.</p>

<p>If now we unravel the countless and confusing Economic
phenomena of our world by assigning each miscellaneous
fact as it faces us to its natural place in
the three categories or Basic Facts, and then observe
with common-sense acuteness the natural laws of cause
and effect that govern the mutual relations of those
Basic Facts, we put ourselves in position to solve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
correctly every Economic problem that can challenge
solution. Not to do so is to invite confusion of
thought and false conclusions. Those Basic Facts are
the “Big Three” of the Economic universe.</p>

<p>Hints at all this came to us in passing through our
Lesson on Economics, our Lesson on Money, and our
Lesson on Trade. For confirmation of those hints and
of the generalizations of the present Lesson, let us
with Money in hand and Trade in mind visit one of
the Trade terminals which are known in every-day
speech as “retail stores.”</p>

<p>What do we see at this “store” but a complex aggregation
and combination, in multitudinous and confusing
variety, of the services of Man in producing Artificial
Objects from and upon Natural Resources to
ultimate consumers through channels of Trade and in
terms of Money?</p>

<p>The number of those products here assembled, together
with the complexity of the infinite detail involved
in their production, would be bewildering were
we to plunge into the ocean of particular facts unequipped
with a clear mental grasp of the Basic Facts
and their mutual Economic relations. For illustration,
here is a barrel of potatoes to which the store clerk
calls our attention with a view to delivering it to us
in Trade for some of our Money.</p>

<p>Now, what could be simpler at first thought than a
barrel of potatoes as an Economic fact? A farmer
has “raised” the potatoes and brought them to market,
where we may have them for their Money price. But
what of the farmer’s “help”? and the plough with
which he prepared the ground? the hoe or more modern
implement he used in the processes of cultivation and
of reaping the crop the horses or the motor he
ploughed with? the building in which he stored the
crop before marketing it? the wagon he carried it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
market in? the transportation equipment with which
it was carried from a larger market place to this retail
store? the factories in which the barrel was promoted
from lumber to its present condition of usefulness?
the factories and stores and railroads and
ships and wagons and tools? the banks and book-keepers
and truckmen? All such factors must be taken
into account, with many more, in their vast and various
and intricate relationships, if we are to know the
Economic history and to solve the Economic problems
regarding even so familiar an Artificial Object as a
barrel of potatoes on sale at a retail store.</p>

<p>Every one of those Economic details can be considered
intelligently, readily and accurately, through
the medium of the three Basic Facts, into one or another
of which must fall, not only that barrel of potatoes
and all the details of its production, but also
the entire stock of the store, and of all other stores,
and every Economic agency back of them to the very
beginning of each productive process through which
they have passed. All Economic details, the familiar
and the unfamiliar, the obvious and the mysterious,
the known and the unknown, generalize with precision
into the three Basic Facts of Economics—Artificial
Objects, Natural Resources and Man.</p>

<p>Natural Resources are the source and the indispensable
condition at every stage, from beginning to
end, in the production of every kind of satisfaction for
human wants. Man is the active agent at all stages.
Artificial Objects constitute the category into which
each result generalizes at each stage of production.
From Economic particulars we derive knowledge of
Economic detail and skill in applying that knowledge;
but only from their correct generalization can we derive
Economic wisdom.</p>

<p>Thinking <em>about</em> the three Basic Facts is necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
to an understanding of their mutual relations; thinking
<em>from</em> them is necessary to an understanding of the
mutual relations of their constituent parts. Reversely,
we must think from Man to Man-power of numerous
kinds, both mental and physical; from Natural Resources
to soil, minerals, air, water, building sites, and
so on; from Artificial Objects to houses, tools, machinery,
food, clothing, et cetera.</p>

<p>In another form of statement, the Economic student
must know and understand the comprehensive categories
or Basic Facts in order to grasp the Why of
Economic adjustments, the natural relationship of
Economic effects and causes. To understand the How,
he must also know and understand the little facts of
Economic specialization, such as the mutual relations
of the details which go to make up those wholes—the
particular facts, for instance, of agriculture or architecture
or engineering or merchandizing or manufacturing
or banking or professional service,—as well as
their three comprehensive classifications or Basic
Facts—Man, Natural Resources and Artificial Objects.</p>

<p>One of the deplorable tendencies in Economic study
comes from a disposition among advanced students
to think exclusively within such narrow fields as banking,
manufacturing, transportation, merchandizing, the
cotton trade, the silk industry or agriculture. All
trustworthy Economic thinking must be from fundamentals—from
Natural Resources, Man and Artificial
Objects—to the minute details of the respective Economic
specializations. All Economic specializations,
to the uttermost of their Economic minuteness, are
subject fundamentally and in their mutual relations
to the natural Economic laws that govern the inter-relationship
of the three Basic Facts—Artificial Objects,
Man and Natural Resources.</p>

<p>That barrel of potatoes in the retail store may serve
for an example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>The barrel itself, an Artificial Object, was produced
by Man from antecedent Artificial Objects—staves and
hoops. The staves and the hoops were produced by
Man from preceding Artificial Objects—lumber and
iron. The lumber and the iron had come from trees
felled and ores extracted by Man; the trees were Natural
Resources, unless cultivated by Man, in which
case they were Artificial Objects produced from and
upon Natural Resources (the earth) and descended
from trees which in their earlier days were themselves
Natural Resources. The iron ore was an Artificial
Object produced by Man from Natural Resources
known as ore deposits. So the barrel holding those
potatoes at that retail store proves to be throughout
its whole Economic history nothing but a combination
of many kinds of Artificial Objects every one of which
has been produced and all of which have been combined
by Man from and upon and within the Natural
Resources of earth and air and light and heat and
electricity and other natural characteristics of the
planet that Man inhabits.</p>

<p>So, also, of the potatoes in the barrel.</p>

<p>And like that barrel and those potatoes, the retail
store in which we find them was itself produced
through many Economic specializations and many
stages of industrial progress, each of which, from the
extraction of iron from natural mineral deposits and
the taking of timber from natural forests, was a production
by Man of Artificial Objects from and upon
and within the sphere of Natural Resources down to
the placement of that artificial structure, the retail
store, upon its Natural-Resource site at an advantageous
point for delivering finished products to ultimate
consumers.</p>

<p>As to that barrel of potatoes and that retail store
upon the floor of which it rests, so of all Economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
phenomena. They belong respectively, according to
their respective Economic characteristics and pursuant
to natural law, in one or another of the three categories
or Basic Facts which we have respectively identified
as Natural Resources, Man, and Artificial Objects.</p>

<p>Pursuant to natural law? Certainly. But where do
we get any natural law in Economics? To quote a
sarcastic attempt at refutation, “Do we pick it off the
trees?” Yes, some of it we pick off the trees. Who
can intelligently observe the growth and fruitage of
a tree without recognizing operations of natural law?
How do trees grow except by operation of natural law?
And except by operation of natural law, how do men’s
bodies grow? Is it enough to answer that the growth
of the body is a problem of physical science, which
is subject to natural law, whereas Economic science
contemplates a lawless lot of phenomena? Or men’s
minds, do they unfold without the aid of any natural
laws of human mentality? And what of social or mass
mentality—shall we call it “public opinion” or “herd
instinct”?—how does that phenomenon originate and
develop except through processes of natural law?</p>

<p>As with a tree, so with the whole physical universe,
inclusive of the human body. And as with the human
body, the physical body and the social mass, so with
the mental equipment. Must not all, for their very
existence and for their development also, be dependent
upon and in all their activities responsive to natural
law in one or another of its jurisdictions—responsive
happily or unhappily according to their degree of conformity
or defiance, of devotion or indifference?<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">3</a> For an extended and impressive discussion of the application of natural
law to Economics, see “Natural Law in Social Life”, by W.&nbsp;R. Lester,
M.&nbsp;A., published by The United Committee for the Taxation of Land
Values, 11 Tothill Street, London, S.&nbsp;W. 1, England. For a specific application
to the coal industry, see minority report on the bituminous coal
problem by Warren S. Blauvelt (formerly of Terre Haute, Ind., latterly
of Troy, N.&nbsp;Y.) in the Proceedings of the National [American] Conference
on Social Work at its fifty-third session in 1926.</p>

</div>

<p>Individual activities, whether physical or mental, if
that discrimination be permitted, assuredly work out
well or ill as they harmonize or run counter to natural
law. This must be true also of social activities. The
choices made by human beings, and the influences
which affect their choices, operate to produce harmony
or discord in Economic relationships in so far as they
harmonize or are in conflict with natural Economic
law.</p>

<p>Economics being the science of a certain range of
social activities, “the science of mankind making a
living,” as it has been aptly called—a science, and
not a mere collection of odds and ends of information—the
same conclusions must be true of the science
of Economics as of the physical sciences. Both are
scientific in so far and only in so far as they are
within range of natural law.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, a common contention in scholastic Economic
circles that the science of Economics is not
governed by natural law as the physical sciences are.
The answer would seem to be conclusive, in so far as
that contention is true, that Economics cannot be a
science at all.</p>

<p>Nor are some of the Economics of modern universities
strictly scientific. They disclose a tendency to
confuse business customs with Economic science as if
they were identical. This characteristic of those
“business colleges” of a previous generation seems to
have charmed the “scientific” Economists of some of
our universities. But Economic science and business
customs or arts are not identical. Business arts and
customs which conflict with natural Economic law are
as certain to culminate in disaster as is the life of a
man who, approaching a wide and deep chasm, attempts
to walk across it without a bridge. Such a
bridge cannot be created, it must be produced in accordance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
with natural physical law. The same is true
of Economic processes. As physical science cannot
create, but can only discover and apply natural physical
laws, neither can Economics create, but must be
content to discover and apply natural Economic laws.</p>

<p>The contention that Economics is not subject to
natural law may be fairly regarded as a lineal descendant
of the social doctrine that there are no natural
rights in human relationships, but that human rights
are only conventional. This is the lawless and vicious
doctrine upon which slavery and every other form of
social larceny have rested, from that form which held
the Forty Thieves together, to that modern policy of
“get what you can and keep what you get.”</p>

<p>Economists who can offer any other effective process
for satisfying Economic desires than by the production
of Artificial Objects from and upon Natural Resources
and in accordance with natural laws, Economic
as well as physical, would thereby kill every inference
that may be correctly drawn from any contention in
these pages. But until that miracle has been performed
it behooves all advanced students of Economics
to think, and to think clearly, without active prejudice
or indolent confusion, upon the natural phenomena of
the Economic realm. Give to those phenomena whatever
name you please—my name for them is “natural
law”—the fact nevertheless remains, a Basic Fact in
Economics, that no Man nor any number of Men can
produce Artificial Objects to or from any stage of the
productive process except from and upon Natural Resources.</p>

<p>Natural law in Economics is not comparable with
“common law” in the sense of a coordination and sanctioning
of social customs. Nor is it “business law” in
the sense of a clutter of commercial customs. And of
course it is not “statutory law” in the sense of commands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
from political authorities to obedient citizens.
In Economic science, as in every other science or art
worthy the name, natural law uniformly and inexorably
governs the relationship of cause and effect.</p>

<p>Browning struck a key-note when in his “Abt
Vogler” he wrote of the “manifold music” evolved by
bidding the organ obey, <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If any Economic experiment “works” (as a pragmatist
might say of it), why does it work? What
other explanation can there be than that it “works”
because it is a correct adaptation of cause to effect
in obedience to mandates of natural Economic law.</p>

<p>Consumption of food is a natural effect of the natural
necessity for food—a natural law. Production of
food is a natural effect of the natural need of food for
consumption—a natural law. Resort to Natural Resources
as the sole source and foundation from and
upon which to produce food is a natural effect caused
by the natural need for food—a natural law.</p>

<p>Nor can natural law be limited to the individual man
any more than it is to trees. Associated man also is
governed by it. It is the latter relation that distinguishes
it as Economic. From the natural desire of
individual man for production from and upon Natural
Resources, social Trade develops, not arbitrarily but
as a natural consequence of a related natural cause.
Let thoughtless students and professors of Economics
who deny natural Economic law—the normal conditions
of cause and effect that govern cooperative mankind
in making a living—explain Economic phenomena,
if they can, without reference to Economic cause
and effect, or Economic cause and effect with natural
Economic law left out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>Natural Economic law might, perhaps, be given
another and more accurately descriptive name. Yet
its existence and its potency for good results or bad,
according to obedience or indifference to it, are beyond
all possibility of denial by any Economic student
who knows what it means and who, thinking with
clarity, speaks with a sense of responsibility. Its
name, “natural law,” is simply a common and convenient
term, whether truly descriptive or not, for
indicating the undeniable fact that in Economics as in
every other science, identical effects invariably proceed
from identical causes.</p>

<p>Most plainly and incontestably is that observation
true with reference to the three Basic Facts in Economics.
That they are no haphazard phenomena in
their mutual relations or otherwise must be inferred
from universal experience. Artificial Objects for human
use are produced by Man, and only by Man, from
and upon and only from and upon Natural Resources.
Man does not create. He produces, which means that
he adapts. And in his processes of adaptation or production,
he succeeds to the degree that he conforms
to natural conditions over which he has no control
except by conformity. Call those conditions by whatever
name we may, they have all the characteristics of
natural law, or natural orderliness, over which Man has
no other powers of command than by adaptation of
natural means to artificial ends. Natural law would
therefore seem to be the most appropriate name—law
beyond the control of Man except by his adaptation
of natural resources to artificial effects.</p>

<p>Questions of natural law or no natural law in Economics
aside, however, we are confronted by facts
which common-sense minds cannot escape. Even if
there be no natural laws of Economics—a contention
that would seem to demand more imagination than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
thought,—it is none the less a fact that Artificial Objects
never have been produced, are not produced now,
and in all probability never will be produced on our
revolving globe, except by Man and from and upon
Natural Resources. Also it is a fact, whether subject
to Natural Law or not, that Man cannot live without
Artificial Objects, nor without Natural Resources from
and upon which to produce and consume those objects.
These facts recognized, disputes over the existence or
non-existence of natural law in economics are mere
mental gymnastics which may be ignored without prejudice
to the essentials of any contention in these pages.</p>

<p>The process of human adaptation of Natural Resources
to Artificial effects—or, to use the Economic
term, the process of Production,—no matter how complex,
is continuous from original conceptions in the
human mind to completion and delivery of products
to ultimate consumers by the human mind and hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FIFTH_LESSON"><span id="toclink_40"></span>FIFTH LESSON<br>

<span class="subhead">THE PRODUCTIVE PROCESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Productive Process in Economics is a complicated
sequence of activities in the bringing forth by
Man, from and upon Natural Resources, of Artificial
Objects. It begins with initiatory adaptations of natural
raw materials; it ends with deliveries of finished
products to ultimate consumers, in accordance with
their demands.</p>

<p>Finished products may be catalogued in general
terms as food, clothing, dwellings, luxuries and other
Artificial Objects which have come into the possession
of ultimate consumers for the satisfaction of their
wants. Drawn from Natural Resources, these products
return to Natural Resources in the course of their
consumption, though not necessarily to the identical
places from which they were drawn.</p>

<p>Their substance is indestructible. Man can no more
destroy an atom of the physical universe than he can
create one. His powers in Consumption as in Production
are limited to <em>altering</em> Natural Resources in
location and form. The essential Economic difference
between Production and Consumption is that Production
alters natural objects so as to adapt them to the
satisfaction of human wants, whereas Consumption
alters Artificial Objects in the process of satisfying
those wants. Production is the drawing forth by Man
of Artificial Objects from and upon Natural Resources;
Consumption is the passing back by Man of Artificial
Objects to Natural Resources.</p>

<p>With the processes of Consumption the science of
Economics has nothing to do. Its functions end with
delivery to final consumers. Whenever Consumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
is declared to be a phase of Economics, thoughtful
consideration will ascribe the declaration, not to the
processes of Consumption but to the preceding demand
for Artificial Objects to consume.</p>

<p>The human demand for Artificial Objects to consume
is the incentive to the Productive Process.
Production, therefore, and demand for Consumption,
are Economic correlatives, Production having Consumption
for its object, demand for Consumption depending
upon Production for satisfaction. Without
Production by Man, there could be no Artificial Objects
to consume; without Consumption by Man, there
would be no incentive to produce.</p>

<p>Production must, of course, precede Consumption.
No Artificial Object can be consumed before it has
been produced. But demand for Consumption as certainly
precedes Production. An opposite inference
might be drawn from the fact that particular Artificial
Objects are often produced in advance of specific demand
for them. In fact, however, the output is always
in response to demand, either actual or probable—like
the outflow from a reservoir of water which
follows the inflow but to which there would be no inflow
were it not for anticipated demand. Production
in advance of actual demand indicates nothing more
than that the producers are confident that such demand
exists in embryo. If they err, the Products
have no market; if they have guessed aright, the volume
of Products increases to meet the demand. By
and large, then, demand for Consumption regulates
Production; or, in Economic phrasing, supply in Production
is determined by demand for Consumption.</p>

<p>Being continuous, the human demand for Artificial
Objects to consume stimulates continuous Production;
being progressive, it promotes improvement in
Productive methods and accomplishments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<h3 id="toclink_42">I. <span class="smcap">Human Factors</span></h3>

<p>The Productive Process is accomplished by Man’s
exertions, mental and physical, each of those forms
of exertion being dependent upon the other.</p>

<p>In that connection Man is governed by natural law,
a manifest law of human nature. It resembles the
familiar law of external nature in obedience to which
physical force advances along the line of least resistance.
The former, the Economic law, may be concisely,
accurately and indisputably expressed in these
terms: Men seek to satisfy their Economic desires
with the least exertion.</p>

<p>The validity of that generalization is sometimes
questioned on the basis of the fact that men often seek
to satisfy their desires with excessive exertion. But
is that true? Is it not at best only apparently true?
Although for the purpose of satisfying a desire for
something, one were to walk three miles when he
might reach his goal and satisfy his desire by a shortcut
only one mile long, but which is unknown to him
or is haunted by a dreadful ghost or infested with
predatory men or savage animals, or so reputed to be,
he would nevertheless be seeking to satisfy his desire
with the least exertion. To risk contact with a ghost
or a robber or savage beasts would add much more to
his exertion mental and physical, than a walk of three
miles for the satisfaction of a desire that might be
satisfied by a walk of one. The statement that men
seek to satisfy their desires with least exertion is to
be read with the interpretation that they do so with
the least known and the least dreaded exertion; also
that the desire may include effort for the sake of effort,
for effort desired as in exercise for health’s sake or
exertion for the sake of play.</p>

<p>The Economic principle that men seek to satisfy
their desires with least exertion does not imply that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
all men, or any of them know what the least possible
exertion is. It is least only in their more or less biased
or ignorant judgment. There is no contention that
they do satisfy their desires with least exertion. The
contention is that they naturally seek to do so. Critics
of this natural law of Economics should have a care
lest they fail to “see the forest for the trees.”</p>

<p>Like the principle in physics to which it is analogous
this law of Economics involves the element of least
resistance. As in physics the line of least resistance
may not be a straight line, although that is its tendency,
so in Economics it may not be a direct line.
Nor may it be the same line from generation to generation.
Precisely as in physics physical obstacles
may divert a line from direct to crooked, so in Economics
such obstacles as customs, habits, superstitions
and ignorance may cause analogous diversions.
But as the physical line of least resistance, though
not always the shortest by foot rule measurement, is
the shortest considering obstacles, so the Economic
line of least exertion is as straight as habit, custom,
superstition, advice, ignorance, and other obstacles
permit.</p>

<p>Let the principle be tested by Money measurements.
Will any sane man pay $100 to satisfy any Economic
desire of his which he knows he can satisfy as perfectly
for $75, or $80, or $90, or even more than $90
so it be less than $100? Certainly not. Then the
Economic law in question may be expressed in terms
of Money. Instead of saying that men seek to satisfy
their Economic desires with least exertion, we may
express the same natural law by saying that men seek
to satisfy their Economic desires at the lowest Money
cost. Both statements have the same meaning. The
only difference between them is that the latter is expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
in terms of Money measurement whereas the
former is expressed in terms of human effort.</p>

<p>Another familiar demonstration of this natural
Economic law that men both individually and in the
mass seek to satisfy their Economic desires with least
exertion, is the human craving for Labor-saving invention.
Could any more comprehensive exemplification
of the natural law in question be demanded?
Why does mankind crave Labor-saving methods for
producing Artificial Objects from and upon Natural
Resources, if there be no law of human nature which
impels mankind to seek satisfaction of Economic desires
with least exertion? John Orr concisely sums
up this Economic law in these words: “Very strong
and deep is the desire of men to find the easiest way
of doing things.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The earliest expression of this principle was by
Henry George in 1879. Alluding to Political Economy,
the term by which Economics was then identified,
he wrote: “It lays its foundations upon firm
ground. The premises from which it makes its deductions
are truths which have the highest sanction;
axioms which we all recognize; upon which we safely
base the reasoning and actions of every-day life, and
which may be reduced to the metaphysical expression
of the physical law that motion seeks the line of least
resistance—viz., that men seek to gratify their desires
with the least exertion.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the Economic realm all human exertion is usually
and appropriately distinguished by the technical term
“Labor.” This Economic term for human exertion in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the production of satisfactions for human wants has
been much abused by colloquial interpretations. So
interpreted, Labor is often limited in meaning to the
exertions of persons hired in “lower class” pursuits
for fixed “wages.” For somewhat “higher” grades of
service, “salaries” instead of “wages” are paid. For
self-employers still other terms are colloquially used,
such as “profits” for the services of merchants and
manufacturers and contractors; “fees” for the services
of lawyers and physicians; “commissions” for the services
of salesmen and brokers; and “discounts” for the
services of bankers. Those verbal variations are of
course admissible for such secondary purposes as private
business may require; but for fundamental or
general Economic distinctions which concern the
whole human family, they are recklessly undiscriminative
and hopelessly confusing. This lack of discrimination
is attributable to a tendency in Economic
study toward devotion to infinite detail regardless of
precise generalization.</p>

<p>The result is a confusion of fundamentally different
objects in messy categories, such as Labor with Labor-products;
such as Labor-products with Natural Resources;
such as income from Natural Resources with
income from Labor—as, for instance, “Land” (Natural
Resources) with “Capital” (Artificial Objects). It
is like thinking of oil and water as a chemical compound
when they happen to be in the same receptacle.</p>

<p>Fundamental conclusions in Economics cannot be
based upon unassorted details. Students must concentrate
their study upon the big facts, the Basic
Facts, those primary categories which distinctively
classify the whole swarm of secondary facts. Well
enough it may be not to start out with assumed principles,
nor with the scientific substitute known as
“hypotheses;” but all rational study of Economics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
must begin with the Basic Facts and proceed thence
to a consideration of details with reference to their
basic relations.</p>

<p>The distinctive phase of the present Lesson with
reference to human exertion is exertion of the Economic
type. Whatever its kind as matter of secondary
classification, all human exertion comes within the
meaning of the comprehensive Economic term for
human service, which, as already stated, is Labor.</p>

<p>No more truly in the Labor category are the services
of “wage-workers” than are those of farmers, of manufacturers,
of merchants, of brokers, of bankers, of
architects, of lawyers, of physicians, of engineers, of
authors, publishers, teachers, or the services of any
other useful workers who participate in the intricate
processes of Economic production. All are within
the Labor category. Be the Economic service whatever
it may which any human being—from inventor
to chattel slave—contributes to the satisfaction of
human wants, such service belongs in the same basic
category with every other Economic service. Consequently,
it must be identified in fundamental Economic
classification by the same technical term.</p>

<p>What term may be best for that purpose is of minor
importance, if of any importance at all, since names
are for identification rather than description. Consequently,
the technical term Labor, adopted long ago
by Economists of the highest rank to identify human
service in Economics, is fully justified regardless of
its descriptive qualities. Even as a descriptive term,
what other word could better identify human service
as a whole?</p>

<p>Among the outstanding minor classifications of
Labor is Business, and to this another attaches which
some advanced students in Economics classify by itself
fundamentally. The latter is the service of the “entrepreneur”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
or “enterpriser.” As a secondary classification
this distinction is probably useful; but for
comprehensive Economic study it is as useless as
“carpenter” or “bricklayer” would be. Worse yet, it
is misleading.</p>

<p>The “enterpriser” is a worker whose compensation
for service is not fixed but depends upon the profitableness
of the enterprise he pursues, which may be
any business venture from mining or manufacturing
to merchandizing, and in any capacity from employer
seeking “profits” to salesman on “commission.” To
eliminate this type of Economic service from the fundamental
Labor category in Economic science is not
only useless and misleading but also absurd. The
fact that the “enterpreneur’s” service may or may not
prove profitable to himself—the fact, in other words,
that when he enters upon an enterprise he “takes
chances” as to compensation—does not alter the Economic
character of his functioning. He is none the
less nor any the more in the Man category of Economics
in contradistinction to the Natural Resource
category and the Artificial Objects category. The
only Economic difference, essentially, between him and
the “common laborer” or “wage-worker”—except that
one may be more serviceable than the other, individual
for individual—is that the compensation of the “common
laborer” or “wage-worker” is nominally secured
by contract, whereas the “enterpriser’s” is contingent;
and this difference is not fundamental. To take the
“enterpriser” out of the Labor category in Economics
by assigning him to a fourth fundamental category,
is to trifle with Economic classifications. Why extend
the basic categories of Economics from Natural Resources,
Artificial Objects and Man, to Natural Resources,
Artificial Objects, Man and Enterprisers?</p>

<p>A similar classification of Business itself—which, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
the way, is usually managed by “enterprisers”—would
likewise be absurd and trifling as well as confusing.
What is legitimate Business but human service? And
what else in Economic classification fundamentally
can human service be but Labor? Business is in the
Man class of Economics in contradistinction to the
Natural Resource class and the Artificial Objects
class. No other fundamental classifications are possible.
Consequently, the activities of Business classify
themselves naturally in the domain of Economics as
Labor.</p>

<p>And so of the professions.</p>

<p>So, too, of every other kind of human service in the
Productive Process, whether the service take on such
direct forms of Production as making Artificial Objects
and such as delivering them from hand to hand
or place to place, or such indirect forms as promoting
the comfort, the enjoyment, the health, the education,
the cleanliness or what not (provided it be Economically
legitimate), of such human workers as literally
do make or deliver Artificial Objects. All are in the
Labor category.</p>

<p>Labor comprises, too, the serviceable operations of
partnerships as such; also of corporations, of chambers
of commerce, of labor unions; the services of
schools and churches and theaters and social clubs;
of political parties and religious societies—every kind
of corporate service, in short, including the service of
governments—to the extent that such service contributes,
in addition to the contributions of its constituents
in their individual capacities, to the production
of Artificial Objects.</p>

<p>And Production—let the reference to this fact be
not overlooked—comprises Delivery throughout the
whole Productive Process to and including its termination
in delivery to ultimate consumers. Railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
workers and sailors and storekeepers and household
servants and waiters at hotels and restaurants and all
their Economic associates from employer to “menial,”
are producers as truly as are farmers, mechanics or
manufacturers.</p>

<p>Human services of the corporate type, as well as
those of the individual distinctively, are too numerous
and too intricately woven together to permit of detailed
consideration here. It is enough to note that
far and away as some of them may at a glance seem
to be from the Productive Process in Economics, they
will be found upon intelligent inquiry—except as they
may be more or less perverted in operation—to be in
the Economic category of Labor. That is to say, they
are human factors in the Production of Artificial Objects
from and upon Natural Resources.</p>

<p>One kind of corporate service, a comprehensive
kind, should perhaps be given brief special consideration
for the double purpose of illustrating the Productive
functions of every variety of corporate service and
of explaining the Economic characteristics of that outstanding
one of all. This particular kind is Government.</p>

<p>The “business” of Government, to use a colloquialism,
the Labor of Government, to use the technical
Economic term, is comprehensive and effective in the
Productive Process to the degree—a reservation that
applies to all other subclassifications of Labor, from
the lowest grade of “hired man” to the most powerful
partnership or corporation, from the most awkward
apprentice to the shrewdest business “enterpriser,”—that
its functions are wisely and fairly devoted to the
task.</p>

<p>Governments are legislative, executive and judicial
agencies of social wholes. It is their function to contribute
service to the production of Artificial Objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
by preserving public order, defining and protecting
private rights, distinguishing and conserving common
rights, and managing or providing for the management
of common affairs. To the degree that governments
faithfully exercise their legitimate public functions
and refrain from interfering with legitimate private
functions, they contribute to the Productive Process.
This is demonstrated by observable Economic results.
Wherever Government approximates a realization of
its functions, Economic conditions are manifestly
better than where it neglects or abuses them. Evidently,
then, Government is a form of human service
which, like all other human service forms, belongs as
an Economic factor in the Labor category.</p>

<p>And as with Governments, so is it with all other
organizations in so far as their organic activities tend
to promote good order, fair dealing, righteous social
adjustments, peace, and general Economic prosperity.</p>

<p>The essential considerations with reference to Labor
may be compactly summarized in these terms: (1)
Labor can create nothing; it can only <em>produce</em>, by altering
the forms and locations of natural substances.
(2) Nothing but Labor can so produce. (3) Labor is
therefore the sole directing factor in the production
of Artificial Objects from and upon Natural Resources.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_50">II. <span class="smcap">Natural Resource Factors</span></h3>

<p>In the foregoing discussion of the relation of Labor
in its broad Economic meaning to the Productive Process,
it has been necessary, as a precaution in the interest
of clear thinking, to give warning that the technical
term Labor is often blurred in its significance by
colloquial or business interpretations. A like warning
is necessary with reference to the technical term for
Natural Resources. This term, adopted long ago and
quite appropriate and distinctive, is Land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>If it be said that Labor applied to Land produces
Artificial Objects, the Economic meaning is the same
precisely as if it were said that Artificial Objects are
produced by Man from and upon Natural Resources.
But all rational Economic meaning departs from the
statement if indefinite colloquialisms or loose business
terms be substituted for the precise technical terms.</p>

<p>Yet the technical term Land, like the technical term
Labor, suffers in significance from a variety of colloquial
and indefinite business interpretations. Indiscriminately
it may mean open prairie land, or improved
farms, or vacant building-lots, or buildings and the
lots on which they stand, or all of them together. The
absurdity of such undiscriminating interpretations is
obvious to any one who reflects upon the significance
of the three Basic Facts of Economics—Man, Natural
Resources and Artificial Objects.</p>

<p>Such colloquial and business-habit confusions of the
technical Economic term Land, like similar confusions
with reference to the technical Economic term Labor,
often mislead advanced students of Economics as well
as “the man on the street.” In any serious consideration
of the Productive Process it is of the utmost importance
that the Basic facts be kept distinctively and
definitely in mind.</p>

<p>As Labor in Economics means service by and for
Man, and nothing else, so Land in Economics means
neither more nor less than any and all Natural Resources.
It is the technical Economic term for the
Natural Resource factor in the Productive Process.</p>

<p>Without Land, Labor would be powerless to produce
Artificial Objects. But Land is abundant in all
varieties. Trees grow in forests, minerals repose in
the earth, the soil offers itself to the farmer, the sea
to the sailor, solid ground to the builder, flowing
streams to all. Together with the winds, the lightning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the snow, the rain and all the other subtle and
mysterious forces of Nature, those Natural Resources
respond freely to the multifarious energies, the broadening
knowledge of natural law, and the intensifying
skill of Labor. They are among the natural substances
and forces which are comprehended in the
word Land as a technical Economic term.</p>

<p>As Labor is the active factor in the production of
Artificial Objects, so Land is the corresponding passive
factor.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_52">III. <span class="smcap">Artificial Objects</span></h3>

<p>Unless the category of Artificial Objects (which
are the continuous outcome of the Productive Process)
be treated with like fidelity to the meaning of
technical Economic terms, there will still be confusion
and consequent bafflement in Economic study.</p>

<p>Yet such fidelity is sadly lacking. There is an unfortunate
tendency to indulge in the same colloquial
trifling and business habits of speech with the technical
term for this Basic Fact as with the technical
term for the Man factor and the technical term for
the Natural Resource factor. Although Wealth is the
generally accepted technical term for Artificial Objects,
careless uses of this term have well nigh obliterated
its technical significance.</p>

<p>Technically it is correct to say that Wealth is produced
by Labor applied to Land. This means neither
more nor less than that Artificial Objects are produced
from and upon Natural Resources by mental
and physical exertions of Man. So used and understood,
those technical terms enable us to trace Economic
details in the Productive Process easily and accurately
through all their complexities from origin to
destination. We have but to assign them to their
respective categories or Basic Facts and always to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
think of them in that connection. Yet, as with Labor
and Land, so with Wealth. Colloquializations and arbitrary
business meanings of this specific technical
term multiply complexities and make Economic confusion
worse confounded.</p>

<p>By colloquial usage and in business accounts the
word “wealth”—“capital” when used as a sub-classification
of Wealth, that is, Wealth devoted to the production
of more Wealth—has taken on a variety of
misleading connotations. In business accounts, for
example, whatever will bring a price to the owner is
accounted Wealth, or Capital as a sub-classification
of Wealth, whether the object of the price be a building,
a domesticated animal, a slave, a vacant building-lot,
an unused agricultural area, or an improved and
cultivated farm. Some of those items of “wealth” or
“capital” do belong, Economically, in the Wealth category,
buildings and domesticated animals being among
them; but many fall wholly or in part into one or the
other of the two other categories, Labor and Land.</p>

<p>Evidently the science of Economics, which comprehends
the interests of all and not merely those of a
private business, cannot classify slaves as Wealth.
Since they are not and cannot be Artificial Objects,
but are human beings, they belong of necessity in the
Man or Labor category. They differ radically from
animals. In the wild state animals belong Economically
in the category of Land (Natural Resources) as
truly as wild vegetation does; in the domesticated state
they are Wealth (Artificial Objects) as truly as produced
vegetation is; and if used to produce Wealth
they are Capital (Wealth used for the production of
Wealth) as truly as machinery is. But slaves in their
“wild state” are not Natural Resources for the use of
Man, as wild animals are; they are human beings, and
as such they belong in the Man category.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>As used in business accounts and colloquially, the
word “wealth” does, as indicated above, include some
kinds of true Economic Wealth, such as “store goods,”
buildings, farm produce, machinery and other Artificial
Objects. But in those undiscriminating uses it also
includes such Natural Resources (Land) as mineral
deposits, water fronts, building sites, railroad rights
of way; also mere titles to various kinds of property
interests, such as bonds, mortgages, deeds, bank balances,
money in hand and corporation stocks.</p>

<p>Some of the Economically desirable things which
are included colloquially and for business accountings
in the term “wealth” are truly Wealth in the technical
Economic sense, let us repeat, since they are Artificial
Objects produced by Man from and upon Natural Resources—that
is to say, by Labor from and upon Land.
But others are not at all in the Wealth category, and
putting them there has no other Economic result than
confusion. Such of them as consist solely of Natural
Resources belong in the Land category. Artificial
Objects alone belong in the Wealth category. Deeds,
mortgages, bank balances, money in hand, corporation
stocks and the like, belong in no Economic category
at all below the surface of customary titles to property.
They are nothing but evidences of legal title
to property of any kind—Natural Resources, Artificial
Objects, Man himself when and where ownership of
Man by Man is conventional.</p>

<p>To illustrate that species of confusion, for the importance
of precise discrimination in Economic
thought cannot be overemphasized in Economic study,
a farm is often accounted “wealth” or “capital” in colloquial
and business usage. So of its purchase “price”
or “value,” and also of a mortgage upon it. Yet its
purchase price and a mortgage are merely evidences
of title to property. Neither of them is Wealth or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Capital within the meaning of precise Economic terminology.
If they were, the more the mortgages upon
a farm the more valuable it would be. A farm the
purchase price of which is ten thousand dollars would
be worth fifteen thousand if it were mortgaged for
five, and seventeen if it carried a second mortgage for
two. And that would be absurd. The farm itself
really consists of a combination of Artificial Objects
and Natural Resources—that is to say, of Wealth and
also of Land—two radically different things as matter
of Economic discrimination. Its site is a Natural Resource,
its untilled soil is a Natural Resource, the
space which it and its surrounding atmosphere occupy
are Natural Resources. All those characteristics are
in the Land category. But its artificial enrichments
of soil by tillage or other human activity, and artificial
replacements of exhausted or partly exhausted fertility,
the fencing and the ditching and the buildings,
what are they? what can they be but Artificial Objects,
and therefore in the Wealth category? Nor is this
conclusion vitiated by the fact that permanent improvements
of the soil or location by means of drainage
or “made land” or the like may with lapse of time
lose their artificial characteristics in consequence of an
ultimate natural merging with the site.</p>

<p>A different type of illustration, though identical in
Economic terminology, would be an urban residence
or a building for business. Its site, the enveloping
atmosphere, the space—all these are in the Economic
category of Natural Resources or Land. But the
building is an Artificial Object and therefore in the
category of Wealth. If the building burn down or
be torn down, then the property—the site and the
space it commands—is in the category of Land alone.
In no respect can the site and the space it commands
be Wealth in the technical Economic sense—in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
discriminative sense which identifies basic differences.</p>

<p>In that sense nothing is or can be Wealth except
Artificial Objects produced by Man from and upon
Natural Resources. The common characteristic of
Wealth in the technical Economic sense is that it consists
of natural substances which have been adapted
by human exertion to human uses. Another term
would serve as well, but no term would serve if used
also to designate something radically different.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_56">IV. <span class="smcap">Secondary Categories</span></h3>

<p>In Economic analysis Wealth takes on two aspects.
They are distinguishable by secondary classifications.
One is Wealth in the possession of consumers; the
other is Wealth in process of utilization by Labor for
the production of further Wealth. For the former
no technical Economic term is in use; for the latter
the technical Economic term is Capital.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_56a">1—<i>Capital</i></h4>

<p>Capital is a highly important technical term in Economics.
It must not be confused, therefore, with the
same word as loosely used in business accounts, where,
like the term for its parent category, Wealth, it mingles
such essentially different things as Wealth and Land—Artificial
Products and Natural Resources. And, as
observed in a preceding paragraph, not only such different
things as Wealth and Land, but in some circumstances
Labor also.</p>

<p>Such undiscriminating uses of the term Capital are
doubtless defensible enough in business accountings;
for in private business anything may be thought of as
business “capital” if it can be summarized in terms
of Money. But for Economics as a comprehensive
social science, the dumping into the same basic category
of such radically different things as Labor, Land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and Wealth—Man, Natural Resources and Artificial
Objects—is indefensible and miraculously confusing.</p>

<p>Limited strictly to distinguishing Wealth consumed
in the process of producing more Wealth—Artificial
Objects devoted to further production of Artificial
Objects,—the term Capital is a convenient subclassification
of some kinds of Wealth. To appreciate that
characterization one need but think, for instance, of
any sort of productive machinery. Is it not an Artificial
Object? Is it not produced by Labor? Is it
not produced from and upon Land? Is it not used
by Labor upon Land for further production of Artificial
Objects? And are not those observations true
also of seed gathered and saved for planting? of minerals
mined for metal? of metal to be transformed
into productive machinery? of food material turned
into food at a restaurant? Are they not true of every
kind of intermediate product—from Machinery (which,
though finished as machinery, is only an intermediate
factor in the process of producing Wealth for ultimate
consumption), back to the rawest of artificial
raw materials and forward through all gradations to
the food on a dinner table, the clothing on a diner’s
body, the floor under his feet and the roof over his
head?</p>

<p>One obsession regarding Capital, even when the
term is used with Economic accuracy, is that it consists
of saved Wealth. There is no such process, in
any literal sense, as saving Wealth—Artificial Objects—except
for ripening or reproduction purposes. Even
for those purposes the saving is in the nature of using,
its object being the production of more Wealth rather
than preserving this Wealth. Any saving of Wealth
in the Economic sense, consists in utilizing it in the
Productive Process.</p>

<p>Are art objects exceptional? Not such as are relatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
reproducible. Only “uniques” are exceptions, if
indeed they may be regarded as within the boundaries
of Economics. Saved over long periods, hundreds
upon hundreds of years in some instances, these would
seem to be out of the field of contemporary Economics.
What gives them their extraordinary value? The same
kind of non-Economic sentiment, on a higher plane,
perhaps, that gives extraordinary value to heirlooms.
Such products are not Wealth in the Economic sense
any more than sacred tombstones are. Though produced
by Man from and upon Natural Resources, they
cannot be satisfactorily reproduced. They are closer
to the nonproducible Natural Resource category than
to the reproducible Wealth category.</p>

<p>That titles to Wealth may be saved is true enough.
But in no extensive sense can Wealth itself be saved.
Unless consumed in the production of more Wealth,
or in the satisfaction of human desire, Wealth goes to
waste.</p>

<p>Titles to Wealth, except such as are specific like the
title to a particular house, are titles not to existing
Wealth but to future Wealth. A title to a house,
being specific, testifies to property rights in a particular
structure which is in process of consumption. A title
to its site is not a title to Wealth, but to Land, which,
however, may be exchanged for Wealth. Such general
titles as Money obligations declare, are titles to
anything upon the market when demanded, including
Wealth that may have been produced years after the
total consumption of everything for which the Money
title was originally exchanged. One’s “savings” in
the form of Money or credits are not Wealth produced
but titles to Wealth not yet delivered to him, and perhaps
yet to be produced.</p>

<p>Only in the sense of withholding for use or of using
or permitting its use in further Production of Wealth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
is Wealth actually saved; and such saving is part of
the Productive Process. It is a dedication of that
portion of produced Wealth to service in the production
of further Wealth. Wealth so dedicated is Capital.</p>

<p>A familiar example is seed saved for sowing. Also
seed sown for growing. And seed in the barn awaiting
the sowing season, that too is Capital. Seed in
the field sprouting and growing and producing grain
for the coming harvest, is likewise Capital. The ripened
grain ready for harvest is Capital in turn, for
it, too, is Wealth to be utilized in the production of
more Wealth—bread or seed or both.</p>

<p>And so of mechanisms, which grow not as seeds
do but only as the hand of the mechanic coaxes them
into shape. When, for example, a machine which aids
in the flouring of grain is produced, he who owns the
machine owns Capital. He has saved it by putting
purchasing power into a productive implement instead
of putting it into ultimate products for his own consumption.
Owning the machine, he owns bread-producing
Capital. Using it, he consumes it in the production
of bread.</p>

<p>A coffeemill, for further illustration, is a machine
produced by Labor from and upon Land, which, when
Labor uses it for grinding coffee (another product of
Labor from and upon Land) brings the latter product
nearer in serviceability to the ultimate consumer.</p>

<p>For a complex illustration, consider a railway passenger
car. It is Wealth because it is an Artificial
Object produced by Labor from and upon Land. But
does it fall into that subdivision of Wealth which is
distinguished as Capital—Wealth used for the production
of more Wealth? As to its owners it is Capital,
for they are using it to increase their share of Wealth
in process of production; but as to the aggregate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
social Wealth, its passengers, if not using it for productive
purposes, are consuming Wealth unproductively.
To the extent that the passengers are not on
productive missions, but are gratifying their own
wants, a passenger-car is in Economic contemplation
Wealth in process of ultimate consumption to
satisfy wants; to the extent that its passengers are on
productive missions it is Wealth devoted to the Production
of more Wealth, and therefore in the subcategory
which is distinguished as Capital. The fact that
part of its use is for Production and another for enjoyment
does not disturb the principle which distinguishes
Capital from Wealth in process of ultimate
consumption for the satisfaction of wants.</p>

<p>Capital is Wealth in forms that are consumed in the
further or better production of Wealth toward final
forms for ultimate consumption. To save such Wealth
in the sense of preventing its consumption would be
to waste it; but to permit its consumption in the Productive
Process is to give it serviceability.</p>

<p>So with all other details of the Productive Process,
from natural raw materials to and including delivery
to ultimate consumers. Capital is produced by Labor
from and upon Land and in forms of Wealth—either
Artificial materials or Artificial contrivances—which,
being adapted and devoted to further Production of
Wealth, are part of Labor’s artificial materials or
mechanism or both—Wealth produced for augmenting
Productive power. In Economic phrasing, Wealth
used in the Production of Wealth is Capital.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_60">2—<i>Trade</i></h4>

<p>Another prominent sub-classification of secondary
facts involved in the Productive Process is inseparably
associated with Capital. This subordinate category
is Trade, to which our attention was directed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the second stage of our delving down from the surface
of Economics to its Basic Facts.</p>

<p>Trade is an essential part of the Productive Process
in Economics. It is inseparable from Labor specialization.
If some Labor be devoted to the Production
of one kind of Artificial Objects, one kind of
Wealth—food, for instance—the producers of such
Wealth must satisfy their desires by trading with
other kinds of Labor specialists—clothing producers,
for instance—for what the latter make and the former
do not make. Evidently, then, the more minutely
Labor takes on specialized activities, the more extensive
and intensive must Trade become. And when,
as in our civilization, Labor is so minutely specialized
that nobody can satisfy his Economic desires by his
own productive activities directly, Trade is an indispensable
part of the Productive Process.</p>

<p>In form it is an interchange of commodities; but in
essence it is, as already explained, an interchange of
Labor functions—of human services.</p>

<p>Springing out of a manifestation of natural law
which is rightly distinguished in Economics as “division
of labor,” and thus inspiring and facilitating specialization
in the Production of Wealth, Trade is a
natural phenomenon. Within manifest limits and without
extra exertion two producers can produce more
than twice as much as one, four more than twice as
much as two, and so on, subject only to the limitations
of Natural Resources. By exchanging products they
therefore naturally multiply their productive powers.</p>

<p>For a crude illustration, is it not plain that two
frontiersmen working cooperatively can build a habitation
for each quicker and better than either could
build one for himself? Or two messengers, each
charged with one errand a mile away in one direction
from a central point and another a mile away in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
opposite direction, can they not do the four errands
twice as quickly and easily, even if not more than
twice, if they divide their functions? By such division
each messenger would walk one mile out and one
back, two for each and four in all, delivering four
messages; whereas, without such division, each would
travel two miles out (one in each direction) and two
miles back, four for each and eight in all. In addition
to the saving of time and energy, each will have
saved productive capabilities too subtle for specific
enumeration.</p>

<p>The principle of those illustrations applies to the
whole Productive Process. By division of Labor, that
is to say, by Labor specialization, Economic accomplishment
is multiplied beyond all the possibilities of
isolated individual production.</p>

<p>But division of Labor would be useless were it not
for Trade. Each of those frontiersmen must trade his
share in the other’s habitation for the other’s share in
his habitation; each of those messengers must exchange
his claim to compensation for delivering one
of the other’s two messages for the other’s claim to
compensation for delivering one of his. This, then, is
the sum and substance of Trade in Economics—adjustments
of compensation for specialized Production
through division of Labor.</p>

<p>The effect is magical. By division of Labor and
Trade the single individual becomes a vital part of a
comprehensive human organism, of a greater man, of
the Social or Economic Man—a Man of almost infinite
Economic powers.</p>

<p>Those two kinds of Economic energy, making and
trading, permeate the multitudinous phenomena of
that Productive Process in the course of which Man
draws forth Artificial Objects from and upon Natural
Resources, for the satisfaction of human desires; or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to use the technical Economic terms, in the course of
which Labor produces Wealth from and upon Land.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_63">3—<i>Utility, Value, Money, Price, Banks</i></h4>

<p>In connection with division of Labor and Trade we
are brought into contact with the phenomena of Economic
Utility and Economic Value.</p>

<p>Utility is an absolute term indicative of essential
desirability. Value is a relative term indicative of the
relative Utility of commodities; or, more precisely, of
the degree of desirability of one variety of Labor or
Land or form of Wealth in comparison with other varieties.
One variety of Labor or of Land or of Wealth
may be twice as desirable as another, unit for unit,
in which case one unit of the former will exchange in
Trade for two units of the latter. Thus the relative
Utility of a Commodity is indicated in Trade by its
Value.</p>

<p>For measuring Value in all its variations from least
to greatest and comparing these in the Productive
Process, the Economic instrumentality is Money, that
surface layer of Economics through which we passed
in our exploration down to the Basic Facts; and the
synonym for Value in terms of Money is Price.</p>

<p>By way of illustrating Utility, Value and Price, one
may say of a quantity of Wealth in the specific form
of wheat, that it has Utility because it can be productively
advanced to food or be used as seed for the
production of more wheat and so of more food; that
it has Value because its desirability is a subject of
comparison with the desirability of other desirable
things in Trade; and that it commands Price because
it can pass from owner to owner through Trade in
terms of Money. Or of Land in the specific form of
a building-site, one may say that it has Utility, for it
will afford natural support for the foundations of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
dwelling or a store or a factory or a railroad right-of-way,
and command the natural light and the air within
its boundaries; that it has Value because it can be
exchanged for other Land or for Artificial Objects;
and that it has Price because Money or credit in
Money terms may be had for it upon transfer in Trade.</p>

<p>Yet a commodity may have the highest degree of
Utility without having Value or commanding a Price;
or it may have great Value and command a high Price
though of little Utility.</p>

<p>Let us observe here a difference in meaning, often
ignored by advanced students, between the terms
“utility” and desirableness. Thoughtfully considered,
“utility” defines an absolute quality, whereas “desirableness”
indicates a varying relationship. This obvious
difference is often confused by such terms as
“total utility” for Utility, and “marginal utility” for
degrees of desirableness. For an example, the “total
utility” of water is great, because by natural law man
cannot live without water. Yet an abundant supply
of water may reduce its “marginal utility” to zero.
On the other hand, the “total utility” of diamonds is
slight, whereas their “marginal utility,” due on the one
hand to their scarcity and on the other to human
vanity, is great. Such distinctions as “total utility”
and “marginal utility” are nothing but subclassifications
of Utility. They serve no better purpose for
fundamental Economic study than the distinction
which “utility” and “desirability” express without as
much risk of confusing thought. Water, for example,
is none the less useful because it is abundant, even
though its abundance seems to lessen the desire for
it relatively to desire for scarcer things. As to water,
nothing is really lessened but desire relatively to supply.
Nor does the scarcity of diamonds add an iota<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
to their Utility. It adds only to the relative demand
for them and therefore only to their Value in Trade.</p>

<p>To repeat, then, the assertion made above, a commodity
may have the highest degree of Utility without
having Value or commanding a Price; or, it may have
great Value and command a high Price though of little
Utility.</p>

<p>For further illustration of Value and Utility thus
defined, nothing has greater Utility—greater “total”
Utility, if that professorial term be preferred—than
the sun; but the sun has no Value except as its Utility
is controlled by ownership of Land favorably situated
with reference to it; for it cannot be exchanged in
Trade for anything else. Nor has it Price, for Money
cannot buy it. Though it may be bought and sold
to some degree indirectly through the buying and
selling of Land which controls the sun’s utility to
that degree, this value is not sun-value but Land
Value.</p>

<p>Yet all commodities—whether in the Wealth class,
as a house or food; or the Land class, as a natural
building-site, or an ore deposit, or soil fertility, or the
sun to the degree that its light and heat are owned
through ownership of Land—have Utility, Value and
Price. The last of the three is expressed in terms of
Money.</p>

<p>Money is the common medium of Trade. Where
and when Money is in use, he who wishes to trade a
hat for shoes need not hunt for somebody who has
shoes but wants a hat instead; all he need do is first
to find some one who has shoes and wants Money.
And since persons who want Money (which as a common
medium of Trade is in effect everything in the
channels of Trade) are so many in comparison with
those who at a given time want shoes, Money infinitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
diminishes the difficulties of trading commodities.</p>

<p>Money is also a common denominator of Value, as
we have already observed. Without it each of us
would be obliged to express the Value of each exchangeable
object in the complicated terms of all other
exchangeable objects. We should have to say, for
example, that a hat has the Value of a pair of shoes
or of a chair or of an umbrella and so on; that a
pair of shoes has the Value of a hat or of a chair
or of an umbrella, and so on; that a chair has the
Value of an umbrella or of a pair of shoes or of a hat
and so on; and that an umbrella has the Value of a
hat or a pair of shoes or of a chair and so on. And
then we should have to complicate the comparisons
with specifications of quality. But Money terms obviate
the necessity for such vague and multifarious
Value comparisons as are here merely hinted at.
They enable us to say that a hat, a pair of shoes, a
chair, an umbrella are each of the Value of five
dollars, or a pound sterling, or so many francs, according
to the names and fidelity to financial standards of
Money pieces in the places where we engage in Trade,
and according also to the quality of the commodities
specified.</p>

<p>It should, however, be here repeated and emphasized,
that Money pieces in whatever form, be it coin or
scrip, are themselves of slight practical importance in
the ramifications of Trade. Not tangible Money, but
the Money terms which measure and express the
relative Values of commodities—these play the great
part.</p>

<p>In adjustments of Trade outside the pocketmoney
class of transactions, Money pieces do not serve to
the extent of five per cent. Nearly all those adjustments
are effected by means of Money terms in books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
of account and through the medium of checks and
drafts and notes and bills of exchange. These are in
effect orders upon banks (one of the forms of Labor)
for the transfer of credits recorded in their books of
account.</p>

<p>Banking is an improvement upon Money pieces in
Trade, very much as Money pieces are an improvement
upon crude barter. It lifts the Money-piece customs
of Trade to book-keeping levels. If everybody
were a bank depositor, and every bank were connected
with every other by a perfected clearinghouse system,
all necessity for Money pieces, except for “pocket
cash,” would vanish. In that event the check and the
promissory note and the bill of exchange, operating
as orders to the book-keepers of banks and clearinghouses,
would effect transfers of debits and credits the
world over so that all Trade would be barter systematized—plain
barter freed from the obstructions
incident to barter in primitive Economic circumstances.
Except for the use of “pocket cash,” Money pieces of
every kind, whether metal or paper, would be like
children’s toys to grown-ups.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_67">4—<i>Balances of Trade</i></h4>

<p>Out of worldwide Trade, which, like Trade in narrower
circles is effected by means of Money terms in
books of account and through the medium of drafts
by creditors upon debtors, a subclassification has
evolved in Economics of the business-customs type.
This subclassification alludes to a situation in Trade
between the people in the aggregate of one country
and those of the other countries of the world, in which
the balance for that country is at any given time on
the credit side. Its exports exceed its imports. This
situation is known in the business circles of creditor
countries as a “favorable balance of trade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>The suggestion that such balances are favorable is
doubtless true with reference to banking and some
other business relationships. Business must be better
with banking, apparently at least, when the buying
and the selling of drafts on the people of foreign
countries is brisk than when it is dull. It must be
better, also, with exporters who draw the drafts and
sell them. The drawing and the selling of drafts
against foreign balances is surely a more profitable
occupation when there is an excess of exports to draw
against than when the balance of trade is the other
way. It must be even more satisfactory in those connections
when the excess of exports is continuous.</p>

<p>But as matter of comprehensive Economics, in which
not only bankers and exporters but also all the other
Wealth-producers of a country are concerned, it cannot
be true that a perpetual credit balance of international
trade is a favorable balance. In international
trading, as in trading between individuals (which, by
the way, international trading in the last analysis is),
the aggregate of exports and of imports must counter-balance.
Otherwise the producers of the exports,
considered as a whole, must be engaged in foreign
trade at a loss. They give more Value than they get.
Surely, trading at a loss is not favorable trading.</p>

<p>Would a farmer prosper if every year he sold a
thousand dollars’ worth of his products and got back
only eight hundred dollars’ worth of other products?
Wouldn’t that depend upon how much credit to him
had piled up in account-books as a result? If none,
wouldn’t he have exchanged his products at the rate
of $10 for $8? How long would a farmer prosper if
he considered that kind of balance of trade as favorable?</p>

<p>Precisely so with international trading. The only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
difference is that in the farmer illustration we have a
solitary individual, whereas in international trade we
have many individuals grouped in national wholes. In
comprehensive Economics that difference is no difference
at all.</p>

<p>A credit balance between national communities is
simply the difference in Value remaining after all international
trading to a given date has been entered
in the books of account. If that balance be on the
credit side of one of the nations, the creditor individuals
of the creditor nation may draw against it. To
them it is a favorable balance, in book-keeping terms.
But if it is never to be paid off with imports, which
seems to be the aspiration of those who applaud so-called
“favorable balance of trade” theories, is it not
in truth an unfavorable balance?</p>

<p>If the reply be that the balance will be paid in gold,
what difference does that make in any comprehensive
Economic sense? Gold itself is a product of Labor
applied to and upon Land. To import it in payment
of international balances would be precisely the same,
Economically, as importing other products of Labor.</p>

<p>Some private businesses may prosper through “favorable”
balances of trade, but Business everywhere
and as a whole, Business in the comprehensive sense
of the science of Economics, must find “favorable”
balances of that unbalanced kind extremely unfavorable
to the people of every nation as a whole and to
most producers individually.</p>

<p>International balances of trade are but aggregates
of individual balances. The favorableness or unfavorableness
of either kind depends upon difficulties of
collection. If, for illustration, an individual has a
credit balance in his account at a bank, it is a favorable
balance provided he may “check it out” at will
in payment for products or services; but to the extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
that obstacles to his “checking out” are put in his way,
the balance has an unfavorable aspect. If the obstacles
be prohibitive—a 100 per cent stamp tax, for illustration,—the
credit balance would be decidedly unfavorable.
It would be unfavorable in less degree only as
the stamp-tax was reduced from 100 per cent, down to
50 per cent or 25 per cent or 1 per cent. The depositor
would have sold more value than he could buy;
that is, he would have “exported” from his products
more than he could “import” from the products of
others.</p>

<p>A like conclusion is inevitable in the aggregate of
world trading. To the extent that exports of Wealth
are not offset by imports of Wealth, to that extent
every trading balance is unfavorable. The Economic
benefit of credit balances of all kinds, whether individually

<h3 id="toclink_70">V. <span class="smcap">An Illustration of the Productive Process</span></h3>

<p>By means of the primary and the subsidiary categories
described and illustrated in this Lesson, all the
tangled data of the Productive Process in Economics
may be readily unraveled. Consider for further illustration
the Productive phenomena involved in so
simple a specimen of Wealth (Artificial Objects) as a
needle in the hands of a house-wife engaged in mending
family clothing.</p>

<p>She bought the needle at a retail store along with
many other needles gathered together in a bunch—a
“paper of needles.”</p>

<p>How did that “paper of needles” get into the stock
of the retail store? It came with other commodities
from a wholesale store. How? By a railway train,
on the complicated structure and management of
which, as well as upon the roadbed, the track and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
station houses, a great variety of Labor had been
expended.</p>

<p>Where and how did the wholesale store get that
needle? Directly or indirectly, and by similar complicated
methods of transportation, from a needle
factory.</p>

<p>How did the needle factory get it? Its workers
made it. How? By means of machinery, Artificial
Products—Wealth used as Capital for the production
of further Wealth.</p>

<p>Of what did those workers make the needle? Steel.
Where did the steel come from? From transformations
of iron in a steel mill. The iron? From iron
ore. The ore? From natural deposits in the earth.</p>

<p>By what magic was all that brought about? By an
infinite variety and complexity of specialized Labor,
which, applied to a variety of special kinds of Land
(Natural Resources)—in country, town and city,—produced
all the Wealth (Artificial Objects) necessary
for the production of more Wealth, namely the Capital;
and this consisted of implements and structures
made from and upon Land by Labor; of implements
and structures for the production of those implements
and structures, also made from and upon Land by
Labor; of transportation facilities of many kinds similarly
made and operated. Also buildings for stores
as well as factories—all in a confusion of industrial
specialties that can be unraveled only by generalizing
the details in accordance with natural law as disclosed
by the Basic Facts.</p>

<p>Let that unraveling be done and still we may be
bothered by collateral problems to which those details
give rise—banking, for instance, and book-keeping all
along the productive lines.</p>

<p>To follow in detail the ramifications of the Production
of that needle from the first effort of Labor to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
which it owes its existence, to its delivery at the retail
store in a “paper of needles” to the house-wife in whose
deft hands we find it, would drive even a magician
mad. But all confusion is banished if we classify the
multitudinous details according to their natural characteristics
respectively, as Labor, Land and Wealth.</p>

<p>And as of the details of that needle’s production, so
of all Economic details, from least to greatest, from
simplest to most complex, throughout the labyrinthine
intricacies of the Productive Process in Economics.
To study separately all the Economic constituents of
even the simplest civilized habitation and their respective
relations to it, Economically, one would need
training in many different kinds of specialties, from
forestry to decoration. Yet systematic Economic
thinking assigns every Economic detail to three categories
which can be studied without risk of confusion.
It need hardly be again explained that those three
categories are Labor, Land and Wealth. Every constituent
of such a habitation, no matter how minute,
is assignable for primary Economic study to one or
another of those Basic Facts—to Land for the site, and
for all the rest, from architectural designing to decorative
completion, to composites of Land and Labor.</p>

<p>Likewise of every other human contrivance for
human satisfactions. In multitudinous detail it is an
inexplicable mystery except to an all comprehensive
body of experts, and even to them if they ignore the
Basic Facts. Yet every complexity disappears when
the details are assigned to their appropriate natural
categories of Man as the sole producer, Natural Resources
as the sole basis and source of production, and
Artificial Objects as the product; or, reverting to technical
Economic terms, when the confused details are
appropriately assigned to Labor as the Productive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
power, to Land as the basis and source of Production,
and to Wealth as the Product.</p>

<p>All Economic details, from least to greatest, from
simplest to most complex, from most familiar to most
mysterious, throughout the labyrinthine intricacies of
the Productive Process in Economics, are like the details
in the Economic history of the house-wife’s needle
of our illustration. What the points of the compass
are to navigation, or the four fundamental divisions
of arithmetic to mathematics, such are the three Basic
Facts to the Productive Process in Economics.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SIXTH_LESSON"><span id="toclink_74"></span>SIXTH LESSON<br>

<span class="subhead">DISTRIBUTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> the outset in this Lesson let the difference between
Distribution of Wealth and delivery of
Wealth be again emphasized.</p>

<p>Delivery is part of the Productive Process to which
the next preceding Lesson was devoted. No Wealth
is finally produced until, finished for ultimate consumption,
it has been produced to ultimate consumers
by final delivery.</p>

<p>Quite another thing is Distribution in the technical
Economic sense. In this sense Distribution is the apportionment
of Labor-produced Wealth in appropriate
categories with reference to the Economic relationship
of Labor to Land—of Man to Natural Resources.</p>

<p>A better term than Distribution, since this term has
been so much abused by giving to it the sense of
delivery by transportation (a mere phase of Production),
would probably be Division. But Distribution
of Wealth has too long served as the technical term
for the Economic division or sharing of Wealth, to be
discarded offhand.</p>

<p>Although the Distribution of Wealth in appropriate
shares, with reference to the Economic relationship of
Labor to Land, affects the sharing of Wealth by individuals,
it does not completely dictate either the
proportions or the magnitude of individual shares.
These may be determined not only by natural Economic
law but also by purchase, by common usage, by
conventional inheritance statutes, by highway robbery,
by forgery, by burglary, by petty theft, by “confidence”
tricks, by lucky speculation or gambling games,
by beggary, by “crooked business,” by generous gifts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
by legal distortions, by taxation, by a thousand and
one other influences, legitimate or illegitimate, outside
the jurisdiction of natural Economic law. Radically
different are those fundamental Economic apportionments
in Distribution with reference to the natural
relations of Labor to Land.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, Economic Distribution is a twofold
apportionment of the Wealth produced by Labor from
and upon Land, whereby one portion is naturally allocated
to Labor as its producer and the other to
Land-ownership as the controller of Natural Resources
and sites.</p>

<p>Presumably, then, as Production of Wealth has two
Basic factors—in technical terms Labor and Land, in
other terms Man and Natural Resources—so Distribution
of Wealth has two basic apportionments, one corresponding
to the Labor or Man factor in Production,
the other to the Land or Natural Resource factor—Wages
for Labor, Rent for permission to use Land.</p>

<p>That there can be neither Wages for Labor nor
Rent for Land unless Wealth has been produced, is a
manifest law of nature. The nonexistent being naturally
indivisible, Production of Wealth must precede
Distribution of Wealth. Inasmuch, then, as Labor
produces all Wealth and without Labor no Wealth is
or can be produced, some Wealth must naturally be
distributed or allocated to Labor as Wages before any
can be distributed or allocated to Land-ownership as
Rent.</p>

<p>Consequently, the Wages allocation of Wealth demands
consideration first.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_75">I. <span class="smcap">Wages for Labor</span></h3>

<p>As with many another abuse of technical Economic
terms, so colloquial and business interpretations have
distorted the significance of the technical term Wages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Even Economic teachers allow their imaginations to
glide away from the comprehensive significance of this
technical term much as they do from its corresponding
technical term Labor.</p>

<p>All too readily does conventional Economic thought,
when considering Wages, center upon the compensation
which “shirt-sleeve” classes of hired men bargain
for, “salaries” taking the place of “wages” when
“white collar” workers cross the business line of
vision. Still more select levels of Labor are compensated
with “fees,” “commissions,” or “profits.” To
thinking students, however, students of Economics
who recognize Economics as a science subject to natural
law rather than a grouping of arbitrary business
customs—to such students all special or mere conventional
kinds of compensation for human service assemble
themselves naturally in the same fundamental
category, and for clarity of thought are always distinguished
by the same technical term.</p>

<p>What the term for natural compensation out of human
production for human service in aid of production
might better be, is of no importance provided the
term be treated distinctively. For Labor compensation
out of Labor-produced Wealth, Wages if treated
distinctively is an appropriate term, and its long time
comprehensive use in Economics entitles it to preference.
Wages, then, the technical term in Economic
science for that natural allocation of some Wealth to
Labor, which produces all Wealth, demands primary
consideration in any study of the Economic phenomena
of Wealth Distribution.</p>

<p>By natural Economic law all Wealth in Distribution
goes to Wages as compensation to Labor, up to
the point at which differences in the desirable qualities
or locations (or both) of particular portions of
Land disclose relatively high and low opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
for Production. In those circumstances Wages for
production on the superior Land would be higher—a
larger product of Wealth—than for the same Labor-power
expended on inferior Land. Consequently another
natural law of Economics becomes manifest.
Rent for superior Natural Resources arises. It is the
difference between Labor productiveness on the poorest
Land in use and the productiveness of equal Labor-power
on better Land. Thus Rent has a place along
with Wages in the primary Distribution of Wealth.
This Economic phenomenon is to be more definitely
described farther on. Meanwhile the phenomenon of
Wages commands our principal attention.</p>

<p>So long as Land freely offers equal opportunities
for Production, the category of Wages comprehends
the whole product of Labor. It is only as variations
in the desirability of particular kinds and locations of
Land play a part in Production that Wages as a whole
are distinguished from total product. In those circumstances,
however, the Wages category embraces the
entire Product less Rent for superior Land.</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred, though, that deductions for
Rent necessarily reduce Wages as a quantity. In
normal circumstances the fact is the reverse of that.
Although Rent reduces the proportion of Wages to
Wealth it does not necessarily reduce the aggregate
of Wages. On the contrary, Wages may be more in
quantity when normal Rent is deducted from aggregate
Wealth than before Rent arises. The reason is
that Rent takes of Wealth only a surplus which is
measured by degrees of superiority of the better over
the poorest Land in demand.</p>

<p>Subject, then, to normal in contradistinction to arbitrary
deductions for Rent, the Wages allocation of
Wealth is assignable to earners in the Labor category<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
in shares approximately proportionate to the desirability
of their respective services.</p>

<p>Subsidiary classifications of Wages are identified
by more or less descriptive terms for colloquial convenience
and private accounting purposes. Among
these terms are “salaries,” “commissions,” “profits,”
“fees,” “labor costs,” and “dividends.” All of them
are doubtless convenient for keeping track of private
business or other personal details; nor are they objectionable
for Economic research provided they be
not considered as primary or fundamental.</p>

<p>All such terms as “salaries,” “commissions,” “labor
costs,” and the like in private or business accounts,
are in the Wages category of Economics. “Profits”
and “dividends” are mixed, very much as with reference
to the Productive Process in private and business
accounts Wealth and Land are mixed. “Profits” may
be and they usually are made up of a mixture of Wages
for human service (Labor) and of Rent for natural
resources (Land). Convenient as such confused classifications
may be for account-keeping in private business
affairs, or for other manifestations of mere custom,
they have no legitimate place in the orderly categories
of social Economics. However useful in business
accountings, which concern only the private interests
of business proprietors, they are intolerable in
the science of Economics, which concerns not only a
proprietor, nor every proprietor, but all mankind.</p>

<p>Even for private accounting purposes there seems
to be a wise tendency among accountants toward more
accurate assignments to normal Economic categories.
One business classification holds high Economic rank
deservedly. This is that subcategory of Wages known
as Interest. Interest may be rightly regarded as the
Wages of Capital. This is no play upon words, nor
any confusion of Economic terms. It is a necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
inference from manifest facts. Since Labor produces
all Wealth, and Capital is a distinct form of Wealth—Wealth
devoted to the production of further Wealth,—Labor
is the producer of Capital; and inasmuch as
the use productively of Capital increases Wealth, a
share of that increase is properly assignable in Distribution
to the Distributive category called Wages,
though for discriminative purposes to a Wages subdivision.
That subdivision is distinguished as Interest.
It is a subdivision in Distribution in perfect correspondence
with that subdivision of Wealth used in
Production which is distinguished as Capital. As subdivisions
or secondary classifications, therefore, the
productive factor known as Capital and the corresponding
Distributive element known as Interest are
legitimate Economic categories, provided their Economic
characteristic as products of Labor be not ignored
nor they be confused with Land and Rent.
This proviso is often ignored, however, as when Capital
is classified with Land instead of Labor, and Interest
with Rent instead of Wages.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of Wages, Taxation
for the support of Government demands passing consideration.
If it be true, as indicated in our Lesson
on the Productive Process, that the legitimate activities
of Government belong in the Wealth production
category as a Labor factor, then the Economically
legitimate income of Government, whether through
Taxation or otherwise, would seem to belong to the
Distributive category of Wages.</p>

<p>Controversies over Taxation take the form primarily
of “Taxation according to ability to pay” versus “Taxation
according to financial benefits conferred” upon
the taxpayer by the social whole of which the agent
is Government.</p>

<p>The former contention—apportionment of Taxation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
according to ability to pay—puts Government in the
position of a highwayman whose “loot” corresponds
to so much of the proportionate property of his victims
as he is able to extort. But how shall taxes be
measured in proportion to governmental or social
benefits received in financial form by the taxpayer?
A sound Economic discrimination might be made by
levying upon Rent only, instead of both Rent and
Wages as is now customary.</p>

<p>But by what right could Government levy upon
Rent only if its claims to an income are as a producer
of Wealth functioning in the category of Labor, the
natural compensation for which is not Rent but Wages?
The answer would seem to be that inasmuch as all
Wealth is produced by Labor from and upon Land,
and as the Rent allocation of Wealth attaches to Land-ownership—Land
itself making no claim to compensation,—Government
might with Economic consistency
exact its Wages as a factor in Production from the
receivers, actual and potential, of Rent, whose ownership
of the Land, valueless without Governmental
protection, rises in Value with Economic progress and
falls in Value with Economic decline.</p>

<p>Such an adjustment would exact no more of Economic
science than appropriate alterations of the
technical terms respectively for the two fundamental
allocations of Wealth in Distribution. Instead of
identifying one allocation as Wages and the other as
Rent, the two could be identified respectively as Individual
Wages and Social Wages. This mode of
identification would in no wise disturb the natural
characteristics of the two allocations into which the
Wealth produced by Labor from and upon Land naturally
distributes itself.</p>

<p>In that connection it may be useful to note the fact
that Taxes on the Wages allocation of Wealth tend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
to check the production of Wealth. They interfere
with Trade, that gigantic factor of Production, by
thrusting the tax upon consumers as part of the Price—not
only the tax, but also business profits on the tax.
On the other hand, taxes upon Rent tend to check the
Economic evil of speculation in Landownership and
the consequent monopolization of Natural Resources
unproductively.</p>

<p>Related to the problems thus suggested is the policy
commonly and widely known as “the Single Tax,”
the fiscal method proposed and widely popularized by
Henry George for initiating and promoting an evolutionary
process in the direction not only of ethical
readjustments of fiscal methods but also of ethical
readjustments of the Economic relations of mankind
to Natural Resources and to Artificial Objects produced
from and upon Natural Resources in accordance
with natural Economic law.</p>

<p>That policy rests upon three Economic principles.
One is the principle that Land (Natural Resources)
is not an individual inheritance but is a common inheritance.
Since no man or body of men ever has or
ever can create Land, it is by edict of natural Economic
law the inheritance of all that are living. But
inasmuch as Land cannot be well utilized (such Natural
Resources as the sea and other open waters
excepted) unless subjected to private possession for
farming, mining, manufacturing, merchandising and
homes, or the like, private possession, control and
management of areas of Land are an Economic necessity.
To adapt that practical necessity, therefore, to
the common right, the Single Tax policy proposes to
make private possession secure without prejudice to
common ownership, by the assignment annually,
through taxation, of the annual Economic Rent or
Value of all Natural Resources to Governmental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
treasuries by way of annual compensation to the community
for the annual values which the community
gives to that Land. Concurrently the Single Tax policy
would exempt Artificial Products and their producers
from all taxation, on the principle that Artificial Products
(Wealth) are the private property of their producers
and purchasers.</p>

<p>The contention of “Single Taxers” is that such a
policy would place Taxation upon a sound and ethical
basis; that it would secure to utilizers of particular
Natural Resources the full value of their use; that it
would properly take from them for the benefit of all,
the value of their monopoly of possession of common
property; that it would stabilize the value of monopolized
but unused Natural Resources (Land) at the
level of their value for use, thereby abolishing speculation
in the future values of Natural Resources; that
it would open opportunities for Labor in its broadest
and fullest sense to utilize Natural Resources in the
production of Wealth (Artificial Objects) from Land
(Natural Resources); that it would remove the artificial
and lessen the natural barriers to Trade; and
that it would bring about conditions of industrial
freedom and equality on the basis of which every
other needed social or Economic reform could rest
securely and function effectively.</p>

<p>As the practical approach to that fundamental Economic
reform—that reform of which its principal and
distinguished advocate, Henry George, said that it
would not accomplish everything in the way of Economic
adjustment, but that without it nothing could
be accomplished, for without it every Economic improvement
instead of raising Wages raises Rent, instead
of increasing the compensation of producers of
Artificial Objects increases the values of the Natural
Resources from which alone Artificial Objects can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
produced and on which alone they can be traded, used
or enjoyed—as the practical approach to that fundamental
Economic reform the Single Tax policy proposes
its application gradually. It aims to substitute
by stages the Taxation of Land according to its value
as a commodity, for the present unrighteous and obstructive
taxation of the actual uses of Land.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">6</a> See “Progress and Poverty,” “Protection or Free Trade,” and “Social
Problems,” by Henry George, and “What Is the Single Tax?” by Louis
F. Post.</p>

</div>

<p>Irrespective, however, of Taxation problems or of
private <i lang="la">versus</i> common rights, and retaining the long-time
technical terms for primary Distribution of
Wealth—Wages as to Wealth not allocated to Landownership,
and Rent as to Wealth so allocated—we
may proceed to our study of Rent for Landownership
as the secondary allocation of Wealth in Economic
Distribution.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_83">II. <span class="smcap">Rent for Landownership</span></h3>

<p>For the use of any Land which is more desirable
in its natural state than the best to be had for the
taking, part of the Wealth produced from and upon
it by Labor is allocated, through operation of Natural
Economic Law, to the Distributive category for which
the technical Economic term is Rent.</p>

<p>That allocation of a share of Labor-produced Wealth
to Rent necessarily diminishes the proportion allocated
to Wages, but it does not necessarily lessen the quantity.</p>

<p>Without Rent, Wages takes the whole Product; with
Rent, Wages can of course take only a fraction of
the whole. Yet as a result of enhancement of Labor-power—specialization,
steam, electricity and other productive
developments—that fraction of the whole may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
be greater in amount than the whole in less productive
circumstances.</p>

<p>Rent is that proportion of total Wealth production
which results from the use by Labor of Land lying
above the Economic frontier, which in Economic terminology
is best known as the Margin of Production.</p>

<p>For illustration, here are two tracts of agricultural
Land of equal area and equal accessibility. One will
yield to a standard of Labor-power more Wealth than
the other, for the soil is richer. It will therefore be
in greater demand by Labor than the other. Consequently,
if its potential yield of Wealth be large
enough and Land of its quality and location scarce
enough to attract Landownership, Labor can utilize
it only on condition of paying to that ownership
a Wealth premium for the privilege. This premium is
Rent. If paid periodically, it would be regarded as
“groundrent”; if the “groundrent” were capitalized
for selling or other commercial purposes it would take
on some such term as “land value” or “selling value”
or “capital value.” But whatever the form or the
colloquial term for it might be, this premium for superior
Land is technically classed in Economics as
Rent. As Ricardo<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> expressed it at a time when
“Land” seemed to mean only agricultural soil, “Rent
is that portion of the produce of the earth which is
paid to the landlord for the use of the original and
indestructible powers of the soil.” Its tendency is to
absorb all the Wealth produced from and upon superior
tracts above what could be produced by like
Labor from and upon inferior ones.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">7</a> “Principles of Political Economy.” Chapter II.</p>

</div>

<p>Still better agricultural Land would extract still
higher Rent out of the Wealth product for the like
special privilege of Production. Thus, with alterations
in the so-called Margin of Production, the natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
allocations from Wealth to Wages would rise
or fall as the Margin receded or advanced, whereas the
natural allocations from Wealth to Rent would rise
with the advances of the Margin and fall with its recession.</p>

<p>The same marginal principle applies to other kinds
of Land precisely as it does to the agricultural, some
advanced Economic students to the contrary notwithstanding.
For a non-agricultural illustration, here are
two mineral deposits. One is more easily worked than
the other, or more conveniently situated with reference
to demand for the mineral product for Consumption.
It is therefore more attractive to Labor than
the other. Consequently, Labor will naturally yield
to the ownership of the superior deposit (Land) a
larger proportion of the mineral it extracts (Wealth)
than to the ownership of the inferior deposit. The
proportionate excess is Rent.</p>

<p>For still another illustration of the same Rent principle,
here are two building-sites in a town or city.
They are of equal size, and in every other physical respect
equally desirable. But one of them is at the
center of the business or other social activities of the
town or city, the other at the outskirts. The former
being in the Economic sense more desirable for Labor
purposes than the latter, Labor yields to its ownership
a larger proportion of Wealth as Rent than to
the ownership of the other.</p>

<p>In a vast variety of special instances, such as those
used above for illustrative purposes, Rent exacts from
the flow of Wealth a continuous allocation which depends
for its proportions to the aggregate flow upon
the desirability of different qualities and locations of
Land (as the Natural Resource factor in the production
of Wealth) relatively to the desirability of such
qualities and locations as may be had for the taking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>“The rent for any piece of land,” writes Max Hirsch,
the Australian economist,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> “is determined by the
excess of its productivity over that of an equal area
of the least desirable land in use, after the sum of
exertions which in both cases yield the most profitable
result has been deducted.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">8</a> Page 127 of “Democracy vs. Socialism.”</p>

</div>

<p>All such exactions are phenomena of natural Economic
law. Land exists in quantities to which Nature
assigns impassable limits, and this limited supply of
Land varies in fertility and in desirability of location.
He who produces from and upon better grades will
naturally achieve greater or better results with the
same expenditure of Labor than he who produces
from poorer grades. This difference is measureable
by variations in the productive grades of Land, from
nothing in excess of production cost on the lower side
of the Margin of Production—the poorest in demand,
the Economic frontier—to something in excess of production
cost on the higher side of the Margin, the
hither side of the Economic frontier, and to more and
more for higher and higher grades up to the best.</p>

<p>It should be observed in this connection that the
Margin of Production, the Economic frontier, is not
a surveyor’s line, like the boundaries of a farm or a
county or a State. It is a term for an Economic difference,
from lower to higher degree in the desirability
of particular Natural Resources though they be separated
by long distances or short ones.</p>

<p>Nor need the intervening space recede from highest
to lowest by geographical degrees, or relative desirability
depend upon richness of soil or mineral deposits.</p>

<p>Trading opportunities may do much to determine
the Margin. A rich gold deposit beyond the reach
of trading possibilities lies below the Margin, for it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
cannot be utilized. A farm twenty miles away from
a trading center would be nearer the Margin than one
two miles away, even though the two farms were
equally productive, because the marketing costs would
affect the Value of the product prejudicially. Space
for a building-site a hundred and fifty feet from the
nearest street line would be nearer the Margin than
one fronting on the street.</p>

<p>Although the old conception of the Margin of Production—“margin
of cultivation,” as it was called—as
bounding an open space of free agricultural land be
obsolete, the principle of the Margin remains, namely,
that the better the opportunity to profit by use of any
location on our earth over use of the most profitable
location thereon to be had for nothing, the higher will
the Rent of the former be. That marginal principle
will persist so long as some locations are preferable
to others. And in those circumstances Rent will continue
and be allocated with reference to “marginal”
or zero-value Land. The better the opportunity to
profit by the use of any location above the most desirable
to be had for nothing, the higher will be the
Rent of the former.</p>

<p>Whether the surplus of Production or possible Production
be called Rent for Land, or deductions from
Wages for superior opportunities to Labor, or be
otherwise distinguished from Wages for Labor, it
none the less exists as a distinct and natural allocation
of Wealth produced from and upon Land by
Labor. Although Rent depends wholly upon Labor
for its Production it is a differential gain in Wealth
which is due not to superior productiveness of Labor
but to relative superiority of different kinds and locations
of Land.</p>

<p>This continuous allocation to Rent of shares of
Labor-produced Wealth may—it constantly does—take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
on Capitalized forms. As Wealth is produced it flows
toward the productive factors in two distinct and continuous
streams—Wages for Labor and Rent for Land.
But as Land has in business custom the rank of a
commodity, the legal right of its owners to appropriate
Rent assumes the form of Capitalized Land Value.
An annual income from Rent, for example, be that
income actual or only potential, may be bought and
sold in business intercourse for a Capital sum or
“purchase money.” Commonly it is so sold along
with the legal Land title by which it is secured to
the owner, but often with Artificial improvements, the
whole being called “real estate,” as if the improvements
and the Land were fundamentally identical.</p>

<p>As a result, the word “rent” takes on in the customary
business sense a different meaning from the meaning
of Rent in the normal Economic sense. In private
business it may mean annual “groundrent,” or
annual house-and-ground “rent”; and when capitalized,
all legal rental rights may be combined in Price or
Value. A concurrent custom is the transformation
noted above of Rent for Land into Capital value or
selling Price.</p>

<p>Such capitalizations operate as mortgages upon future
Production; and as the capitalizations increase,
that kind of mortgage burden grows in Economic
weight. If Production continues advancing, the consequent
increase of Wealth as a whole easily bears the
burden, which rests then upon the naturally increasing
Rent allocation rather than upon Wages. But in
consequence of such capitalizations, Rent tends to become
a football for Land speculation. This results in
excessive capitalizations of Rent, which tend in turn
to lower the Margin of Production, the Economic
frontier, abnormally. As a consequence, Rent exactions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
in the form of speculative Land Prices rise above
capitalizations of Rent at normal levels.</p>

<p>Exemplifications of such Economic phenomena may
be observed in any community where at any time
speculative Prices for Land have figured. In such
circumstances, so long as Wealth is sufficiently increased
by Labor—whether from improvement in
Labor-power or from progressive advantages in Land
opportunities,—increasing Rent is offset by increasing
Wealth, and Economic prosperity abounds. But when
increase in Wealth-production lags behind Rent, prosperity
is checked and a “slump” in Land-values, Economically
perilous, follows.</p>

<p>Other causes of Economic depression than “slumps”
in speculative Land-values there doubtless are. They
spring from such superficial maladjustments in the
processes of Trade as are connected with defective
banking, fluctuations in the values of corporate stocks
and variations in Money standards from lack of effective
stabilization. Even as to business depressions
apparently so produced it is, however, exceedingly
difficult if not impossible to declare with certainty that
the leading part is not played by speculative Land
values. For in our neo-feudalistic era, Land values
are intricately confused with Wealth values in corporation
stocks and bonds. To the extent that Land values
and Wealth values are thus mingled, it is quite impossible
to account for many Economic upheavals
without more distinctive inventories of property in
Trade and more accurate Economic classifications than
in business circles or among advanced students of
Economics have as yet been reached.</p>

<p>Before passing to the next subdivision of Distribution,
it may not be a diversion to direct attention to
the most remarkable distortion of technical Economic
terms that has yet harassed Economic thought with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
confusion. This is the attempt of some Economists
to identify Rent with Wages, by ascribing extraordinary
compensation for extraordinary human service
to “rent of ability.” As a subclassification of Wages
there could hardly be any objection to this assignment
except its tendency to mix Rent for Land with
Wages for Labor in the minds of students. As a
fundamental classification, however, its absurdity is
manifest. Can anybody “rent” his ability, however
great it may be, without putting it at work? Could
the ablest physician, for instance, get a fee unless he
offered to work with his ability? Could the most
brilliant author command royalties unless he wrote
books? Of course not. It is only as one works or
promises to work that he is compensated for any degree
of ability. Although Landownership may command
compensation in Rent for such special opportunities
as the Land offers to Labor, regardless of
whether it is utilized or not, Man cannot rent his
ability without obligating himself to use his ability;
and the man who obligates himself, though he may
call his compensation “rent” if that pleases either his
vanity or his love for confused thinking, gets for his
ability no rent whatever. What he gets is Wages for
making his ability serviceable as a Labor unit. Nor is
such compensation any the less Wages or any the more
Rent, if it be (as with lawyers) a retainer for pledging
future service which in the end has not been required
of him. Compensation for work, or for a contract
to work, is Wages whether the contract be in
consequence of the worker’s ability or regardless of
it. All compensation for service units, from lowest
grades of ability to highest, is in Economic terminology
and analysis, not Rent for Land but Wages
for Labor. The bricklayer, contrasting his Wages
with the Wages of an apprentice, might call his larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
income “rent of ability,” if that flattered him; but his
doing so, though it might enhance Economic confusion,
would not alter the Economic relationship of
Wages for Labor and Rent for Land. If Economic
thinking is to be done with definite terminology instead
of word-juggling, all compensation for human
service must be expressed by a technical term different
from the technical term for premiums for varying
grades of Natural Resources. The accepted technical
terms are Wages for Human service and Rent for
Natural Resource advantages. Though “rent of ability”
be picturesque in dramatics, it is farcical in
Economics.</p>

<p>The importance to Economic study of assigning
every item of Economic phenomena, Distributive as
well as Productive, to its appropriate Economic category—Labor
or Land in Production and Wages or
Rent in Distribution—cannot be lightly ignored nor
carelessly trifled with. Nor can it be too strongly
emphasized. Without such assignments Economic
phenomena are like printers’ “pi”; so assigned, they
may be studied with precision.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_91">III. <span class="smcap">Trade</span></h3>

<p>The Distribution of Wealth, as well as its Production,
is effected through Trade. As in the Productive
Process from the very beginning of Labor specialization
up to the point of delivery to ultimate consumers,
so in the process of Distribution, Trade is the continuous
and the culminating agency. It determines
the kind of Wealth and the quantity that each factor
in Production shall receive.</p>

<p>We have seen that Labor as a whole, a social unit,
produces Wealth from Land and that this activity
and this result are governed by natural Economic law—by
natural relations of Economic effect to Economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
cause. We have seen also that a correlative natural
law, a correlative connection of effect to cause, constantly
allocates one portion of the total Product to
the Labor factor and another portion to the Land
factor. We may readily see, moreover, that those two
primary allocations subdivide into almost infinitesimal
and extremely confusing secondary categories, comprising
every variety of Labor, every variety of Land, every
variety of Wealth, every variety of Economic desire.
It is to satisfy those desires out of that continuous
flow of Wealth that the infinitude of processes indicated
in the next preceding Lesson enter into the comprehensive
Productive Process which includes delivery
to ultimate consumers, and that an infinitude of corresponding
processes enter into Distribution.</p>

<p>Many of those processes overlap, playing now a part
in Production and now in Distribution. Some of them
are natural, some are customary, some are legalistic.
But all are subject to the cooperation or to the obstruction
of natural law as manifestly as is the navigation
of a sailing vessel on the ocean. In so far as the
customary or the legalistic do not conform to natural
Economic law, natural penalizations inevitably result;
in so far as they do conform to natural Economic
law, the results are socially as well as individually
beneficial. As with gravitation in the physical universe,
so with its correspondent force in the Economic
domain.</p>

<p>Not only, then, are the minute details of Labor specialization
merged in Productive wholes and delivered
in their completeness to ultimate consumers by means
of Trade, as we learned in the next preceding Lesson,
but, also by means of Trade, the two great divisions
of Wealth (Wages and Rent) are assigned respectively
to Labor interests and to Land interests in proportions
determined by comparisons of Value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>Individual deliveries, in contrast with Distribution
into the two basic categories, Wages and Rent, consist
in the delivery of Wealth to individuals in proportion
to the effective demands of each. Their demands are
limitless, for when satisfied with quantity they naturally
demand quality. But there is a limit to all effective
demands. The limitation on the one hand is the
producer’s ability to produce, and on the other the
consumer’s ability to obtain in Trade. Ability to produce
depends in high degree at any time upon the
general productive knowledge of the time. Ability
to obtain depends upon the Economic power in Trade
of the individual seeking to gratify his wants. If he
is isolated from all the rest of mankind, he is outside
the Economic circle and can obtain only what he himself
directly produces. If he is one of an absolutely
free community, he can obtain what others are willing
to give him in Trade for the service he renders directly
or indirectly to them. If Production be arbitrarily
obstructed, whether by impediments to Natural Resources
or to Trade, his ability to obtain Wealth is
not so much according to what he produces or to the
service of any other kind that he renders, but according
to his command over the sources of Production
and the channels of Trade whereby he may levy
tribute or escape it.</p>

<p>As human services naturally tend to exchange at
par for equally desirable human services, so do different
forms of Wealth, each product of human service,
tend to exchange at par for equally desirable forms of
Wealth; and as Wealth in the Rent category and
Wealth in the Wages category are alike service-products
of Labor applied to Land, exchanges of every
kind of Wealth tend to be effected on the basis of
equality in the expenditure of Labor for their Production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Let it now be carefully observed and faithfully remembered
in this connection, that however various
the kind and the amount of Wealth that individuals
receive, each variety is but a subdivision of Wealth
as a whole, and is therefore either Wages or Rent,
those being the two primary divisions of Wealth in
Distribution. A “captain of industry” may get a large
share of Wealth for his service while a skilled laborer
gets a small share for his; but each will take his share
from Wages, not from Rent. On the other hand, the
owner of a rich mining opportunity may get a large
share of Wealth and the owner of a small area of
farming land or a village building-lot may get a small
share; but each will in that respect get Rent, not
Wages. To the extent, however, that the “captain of
industry” derives any part of his income from Natural-Resource
privileges, that part is Rent; and to the extent
that the mine owner or the farm owner or the village
lot owner derives any part of his from his service,
that part is Wages.</p>

<p>Thus the factor in Production technically termed
Land is represented in Distribution by the Wealth
element technically termed Rent; whereas the factor
in Production technically termed Labor is represented
in Distribution by the Wealth element technically
termed Wages.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_94">IV. <span class="smcap">Money</span></h3>

<p>All allocations of Wealth, from the two primary
ones—Wages and Rent—to the least of all that are
secondary to either of those two, are made through
Trade, and in the course of Trade are measured by
comparisons of Value, which is the universal regulator
of Trade. And as in Production so in Distribution,
for Value measurements Money is the more or less
stable yardstick and Money terms the spokesmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>Would we know the Value of Wealth in any of its
distributive allotments, we must look for it in terms
of Money. Would we know the Value of any of the
various kinds and degrees of Labor that have produced
it, Money terms offer us the only language we
can use or understand. Would we know the Value
of any of the various kinds and degrees of Land from
which and upon which such Wealth has been produced
by Labor—whether identified by the term Rent
as in Economics or by such colloquial or business
terms as “groundrent,” or “selling price,”—Money is
our sole interpreter, defective though it be. Would
we place any or all of this information on record, we
must do so in terms of Money.</p>

<p>What, then, is Money—this prestidigitateur of both
Production and Distribution? Is it coin? Is it a
promise to pay? Is it a fiat of Value? Is it a magic
signal?</p>

<p>Before considering whether or not it is coin, let us
think of how slightly coin is used in Trade. Before
suggesting promises to pay, let us reflect upon the
variability and questionability of promises. Before
falling back upon “fiat,” let us know somewhat of the
wisdom and responsibility behind the “fiat.”</p>

<p>If we probe deep, as in these Lessons we have tried
to do, shall we not find that the only level of Value
is the Labor level?</p>

<p>Not Labor time. That varies in Value with individuals.
But Labor service or product. And do not
the market prices of stable Labor products come as
near to the Value level as may be necessary for all
the purposes of Trade relations?</p>

<p>An absolute level of Value is doubtless as far beyond
the possibilities as an absolute sea level. But
as we adopt a “mean level” of the sea, why not a
“mean level” of Value? And why not express the relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
of this level in terms of Money properly stabilized?</p>

<p>The most conspicuous method yet suggested for
realizing such a Value level takes the specific form
of a proposal to determine Money standards by frequent
comparisons with the Price level of simple
types of Wealth. Resting nominally upon the Value
in Trade of such staples, this method rests fundamentally
upon the Economic fact that Labor, as the
continuous producer of all Wealth, is the real source
and regulator at all times of all Values in the channels
of Trade, and that Money is the measuring rod and
its terms the language.</p>

<p>To go farther into this Economic field would necessitate
a surface survey of Economic intricacies, and
these pages aim only at clarifying fundamentals.
Having returned from the Basic Facts, upon which all
Economic details rest, to the Money surface with
which it began, our common-sense primer for advanced
students is at the end of its task.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SEVENTH_LESSON"><span id="toclink_97"></span>SEVENTH LESSON<br>

<span class="subhead">REVIEW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> science of Economics, having now been traced
from its surface to its three Basic Facts and back
to the surface, let us, for the purpose of bringing the
whole subject compactly within its narrowest limits,
retrace our steps briskly but thoughtfully by way of
review.</p>

<p>Economic accomplishments are measured by Money
standards and expressed in Money terms. Resting
on the surface, those standards and terms spread over
the whole Economic area.</p>

<p>Beneath that surface we first find Trade, for which
Money is the medium or the means of expressing relative
values and adjusting balances. Trade consists
essentially in interchanges of commodities, inclusive of
natural resources and of human service. It is not an
arbitrary custom or set of customs, but a phenomenon
of natural law through which artificial objects are
produced to completion and final delivery. But Trade,
though lying beneath the Money surface of Economics,
is not a basic fact of that science.</p>

<p>Only by piercing through the Trade surface as well
as the Money surface, can the bottom level of the
Basic Facts of Economics be reached. Those facts
consist of distinct categories which comprehend in generalized
forms the myriads of miscellaneous facts with
which the Science of Economics is concerned.</p>

<p>Of those categories or Basic Facts there are in number
neither more nor less than three—Man, Natural
Resources, Artificial Objects.</p>

<p>All Artificial Objects are produced by Man from
and upon Natural Resources. The technical term for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
the activities of Man in that connection is <em>Labor</em>; for
Natural Resources, <em>Land</em>; and for Artificial Objects,
<em>Wealth</em>. In technical Economic terms, therefore, all
Wealth is produced from and upon Land by Labor.</p>

<p>Many colloquial and business subdivisions of those
three categories may be useful provided they be not
mixed in their meanings.</p>

<p>One of those subdivisions is Capital, which, in its
technical meaning, is distinctively a part of Wealth
produced by Labor from and upon Land. It is, however,
often used loosely to include Land, the technical
term for Natural Resources. Even slaves, and by
Economic as well as by private business classification,
have been placed in the subcategory called Capital, a
form of Wealth; and this notwithstanding that as
units of the human factor, slaves belong in the Labor
category of Economics. Although such loose distinctions
may be of use in private business accountings,
they are intolerable in the science of Economics, which,
like every other science, demands precision in the differentiation
of terms.</p>

<p>The application of Man’s powers of body and mind
to Natural Resources for the production of Artificial
Objects—of Labor to Land for the production of
Wealth—is the Productive Process in Economics. It
involves such subcategories as business enterprise,
professional service, invention, hired-man work—in a
word, every grade of useful activity. These subcategories
are developed by industrial specialization, or,
in technical Economic terms, Division of Labor, which
necessitates another subcategory. This is Trade.</p>

<p>Without Trade, products of Labor specialization
would remain forever useless; but through Trade the
most minute and incomplete of those products is
brought to its useful place in the aggregate of Wealth—ploughshares
to ploughframes, for instance, or ore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to the steel of the factory, or wallpaper to the interior
of the house.</p>

<p>The Productive Process though intricate through
specialization and Trade, is readily observable by
generalization into the three major categories, Labor
and Land and Wealth. In observing that Process
care must be taken to distinguish delivery from Distribution.
Delivery is part of the Productive Process.
No Wealth is completely produced until it has been
delivered to ultimate consumers. But Distribution
has to do with Wealth apportionment.</p>

<p>In apportionment, or Distribution, there are two
major categories, Wages and Rent, corresponding respectively
to the two Production categories, Labor
and Land. A minor Distributive category, corresponding
to the minor category in Production called
Capital, is distinguished as Interest. This term identifies
the earnings of Capital. Inasmuch, however, as
Capital is part of Labor-produced Wealth, Interest
must be a subdivision of Labor-earned Wages.</p>

<p>The Wages category in Distribution comprises,
fundamentally, all that part of Labor-produced Wealth
which is not allocated by natural Economic law to
Rent for permission to use Land. This allocation is
determined by the greater desirability of some Natural-Resource
locations (Land) over the most desirable
that may be had for the taking—of those at the
“Margin of Production” as it is technically called, the
“margin of cultivation” as it was called when agricultural
areas alone were thought of as Land, at the
Economic frontier as it may be most significantly described.</p>

<p>All assignments of Wealth in Distribution being
determined by comparisons of desirability of service
(Value measured in terms of Money), we find ourselves
at the close of our brief review back at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Money surface of Economics where we began our delving
expedition down to the Basic Facts.</p>

<p>As a result of that expedition we know, if we think
with clarity and fidelity, that Economics is the science,
not of making Money, but of Producing and Distributing
Artificial Objects from and upon Natural Resources
by Man. The usefulness of our expedition
depends upon our grasp of and fidelity to the generalization
of all Economic facts into those Basic Facts
which are respectively distinguished in Economic terminology
as Land, Labor and Wealth.</p>
